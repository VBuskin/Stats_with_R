## Preparation

The first section of an R script should always specify the libraries
that are needed for executing the code to follow. In this unit, we will
need `readxl` and `writexl` to aid us with importing MS Excel files.

```{r}
library(readxl)
library(writexl)
```

If you haven't installed them yet, the R console will throw an error
message. For instructions on how to install an R package, consult the
unit on [Libraries](Libraries.qmd).

### Exporting data

Assume we'd like to export our data frame with word frequencies to a
local file on our system. Let's briefly regenerate the data frame:

```{r}
# Generate data frame
data <- data.frame(lemma = c("start", "enjoy", "begin", "help"), 
                   frequency = c(418, 139, 337, 281))

# Print contents
print(data)
```

There are two common formats in which tabular data can be stored:

-   as .**csv**-files ('**c**omma-**s**eparated **v**alues'; native
    format of LibreOffice Calc)

-   as .**xls**/.**xlsx**-files (Microsoft Excel)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Export to CSV"}
To save our `data` data frame in .csv-format, we can use the
`write_table()` function:

```{r}
write.csv(data, "frequency_data.csv")
```

The file is now stored at the location of your current R script. You can
open this file ...

-   in **LibreOffice**

-   in **Microsoft Excel** via `File` \> `Import` \> `CSV file` \>
    Select the file \> `Delimited` and then `Next` \> `Comma` and `Next`
    \> `General` and `Finish`.

Clearly, opening CSV files in MS Excel is quite cumbersome, which is why
it's better to export it as an Excel file directly.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Export to Excel"}
We use the `write_xlsx()` function provided by the package `writexl`.

```{r}
write_xlsx(data, "frequency_data.xlsx")
```

The file is now stored at the location of your currently active R
script. You should now be able to open it in MS Excel without any
issues.
:::

### Importing data {#sec-import}

Let's read the two files back into R.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Import from CSV"}
To import the CSV file, we can use the `read.csv()` function:

```{r}
imported_csv <- read.csv("frequency_data.csv")
print(imported_csv)
```

It appears that `read.csv()` has also written the row numbers to the
file. This is not the desired outcome and can be prevented by adding an
additional argument:

```{r}
imported_csv <- read.csv("frequency_data.csv", row.names = 1)
print(imported_csv) # Problem solved!
```

::: {.callout-warning collapse="true" title="A note on file encodings and separators"}
When working with CSV files, you may encounter issues with character
encodings and separators, especially when:

-   working with files from different operating systems,
-   dealing with text containing special characters (é, ü, ñ, etc.), or
-   importing files created in different regions (e.g., European vs.
    US).

The most common encoding-related parameters for read.csv() are:

```{r, output = F, eval = F}
# For files with special characters (recommended default)
data <- read.csv("myfile.csv", encoding = "UTF-8")

# For files from Windows systems
data <- read.csv("myfile.csv", encoding = "latin1")

# For files using semicolons and commas as decimal points
data <- read.csv("myfile.csv", sep = ";", dec = ",")
```

-   If you see garbled text like Ã© instead of é, try specifying
    `encoding = "UTF-8"`.
-   If your data appears in a single column, check if your file uses
    semicolons (`;`) instead of commas (`,`) as separators.
-   If numeric values are incorrect, verify whether the file uses commas
    or periods as decimal separators.
:::
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Import from Excel"}
For importing the Excel file, we'll use the `read_xlsx()` function from
the `readxl` package:

```{r}
imported_excel <- read_xlsx("frequency_data.xlsx")
print(imported_excel)
```
:::

That's it! Nevertheless, remember to always check your imported data to
ensure it has been read in correctly, especially when working with CSV
files.

## A convenient alternative: RDS files

If the main goal is to save an intermediary result and make it available
for later use, the most efficient solution is to save the object to a
local R data file ending in `.RDS`. Since it compressed data, .RDS files
can be considered analogous to .zip files, which are very commonly used
for other data types.

In practice, we use the `saveRDS()` function and supply it with ...

-   ... an R object (e.g., a vector, data frame, matrix, graphs,
    statistical models -- anything goes!) as well as

-   ... the desired name of the file.

```{r}
# Save data frame "data" to the file "frequency_data.RDS"
saveRDS(data, "frequency_data.RDS")
```

To read a file back in, we need to indicate the file name (or the full
file path if the file is located in a different folder).

```{r}
# Read in "frequency_data.RDS" and assign the contents to "data2"
data2 <- readRDS("frequency_data.RDS")

# Verify contents
print(data2)
```

## Troubleshooting

Importing data into R is often a challenging and error-prone task, made
more difficult by the wide range of potential issues. **AI tools** can
be immensely helpful for identifying and addressing problems specific to
your use case. [This handout](Using_AI.qmd) provides some practical
guidance, including tips for resolving file-loading errors.

## Solutions

You can find the solutions to the exercises
[here](https://osf.io/gkvmr).
:::

::: {#exr-impexp-1}
Download the file `SCOPE_reduced.RDS` from [this
repository](https://osf.io/3w29d) and read it into a variable named
`SCOPE`. It contains data from the the South Carolina Psycholinguistic
Metabase [@gaoSCOPESouthCarolina2022], specifically:

-   Number of meanings (`Nsenses_WordNet`)

-   Emotional valence ratings, which describe the pleasantness of a
    lexical stimulus on a scale from 1 to 9 (`Valence_Warr`)

-   Data for nearly 200,000 words
:::

::: {#exr-impexp-2}
Using this database, retrieve

1.  the number of meanings for the verbs *start*, *enjoy*, *begin*,
    *help*. Store them in a data frame with the name `senses_df`.
2.  emotional valence ratings for the words *fun*, *love*, *vacation*,
    *war*, *politics*, *failure*, *table*. Store them in a data frame,
    and name it `valence_df`.

What do you notice about the valence ratings? Do they align with your
intuitions about these words' emotional content?

::: callout-tip
This task is very similar to @exr-df-3!
:::
:::

::: {#exr-impexp-3}
Export `senses_df` and `valence_df` both as .csv and .xlsx files, and
read them back into R.

```{r}

```
:::

::: {#exr-impexp-4}
Separators determine how tabular data is stored internally. Investigate
what happens when you read in `frequency_data.csv` with different
separator settings:

```{r, output = FALSE}
# Comma separator (default)
imported_csv1 <- read.csv("frequency_data.csv", sep = ",")
print(imported_csv1)

# Tab separator
imported_csv2 <- read.csv("frequency_data.csv", sep = "\t")
print(imported_csv2)

# Semi-colon separator
imported_csv3 <- read.csv("frequency_data.csv", sep = ";")
print(imported_csv3)

```
