    "text": "Preface\nThis collection of handouts provides a hands-on introduction to data analysis and statistical methods in quantitative corpus linguistics with R. It is designed with accessibility in mind, assuming no prior knowledge of programming or statistics. All you need to get started is a laptop; everything else will be explained within these pages.\nPrimarily, this reader is geared towards students attending the classes Language Variation (BA) and Statistics for Linguistics (MA) at the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt (Germany). However, it is also meant to equip students currently working on their BA/MA/PhD theses with the tools they need to conduct empirical studies on a wide array of linguistic phenomena. The methods presented here reflect the state-of-the-art in corpus-linguistic research, providing readers with current and relevant analytical techniques.",

    "text": "Overview\nWe begin by establishing the general structure of corpus-linguistic studies, accompanied by key theoretical and practical considerations. The second section introduces R as an analytical tool, covering its core functionality. With these fundamentals in place, we proceed to query corpora directly within R. Chapters four and five focus on describing discrete and continuous outputs, as well as identifying meaningful associations and differences in the data (BA). Finally, to gain more nuanced insights into potential patterns, we apply common machine learning algorithms to fit, evaluate, and interpret statistical models (MA).\nThroughout this journey, readers will develop the skills to conduct robust corpus-linguistic analyses, from basic querying to advanced statistical modeling.",

It is better to make a small contribution to a particular problem than to aim at covering a whole subfield of sociolinguistics.\nKeep a research question stable in your paper, even if you come across interesting new ideas as you work on it.\nThe research question must be an explicit part of your paper. Mention it in the introduction and keep referring back to it from time to time.\nKeep in mind that the research question will determine both methodology and data.\n\n\nCf. Hazen (2015): 9–10\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Hypotheses\nResearch questions must be complemented by a set of falsifiable hypotheses. These are covered in-depth under Inferential statistics &gt; Hypothesis testing. In short,\n\nHypothesis H1 predicts a specific relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable.\nits opposite, Hypothesis H0, describes the state of affairs where the predicted relationship between the variables does not hold.\n\nThe predictions made by the hypotheses are based on previous research. Here is an example:\nResearch question: I am studying the pronunciation of [r] in New York because I want to find out whether different social groups differ with respect to their pronunciation, in order to help my readers understand how social factors influence our linguistic behavior.\n\nHypothesis H1: Upper-class speakers will use postvocalic /r/ more frequently than lower-class speakers.\nHypothesis H0: Upper-class speakers will not use postvocalic /r/ more frequently than lower-class speakers.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Practice\nTask: Develop valid research questions on the basis of the following linguistic variables:\n\nSpeakers in bilingual conversations are especially likely to code-switch when there is a significant change of topic.\nWomen use more tentative language in conversations than men.\n\n\n\n\n\nBooth, Wayne C., Gregory G.

There’s no need to obtain any expensive licenses, as it is the case for commercial software such as SPSS or MS Excel.\nR makes it very easy to document and share every step of the analysis, thereby facilitating reproducible workflows.\nLarge (and by that I mean extremely large!) datasets pose no problems whatsoever. Loading tabular data with hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of rows only takes a few seconds, whereas most other software would crash.\nThere are numerous extensions that provide tailored functions for corpus linguistics that aren’t available in general-purpose spreadsheet software. This allows us to work with corpora, use complex search expression, perform part-of-speech annotation, dependency parsing, and much more – all from within R.\nR’s ggplot2 offers an incredibly powerful framework for data visualisation. Don’t believe it? Check out the ggplot2 gallery.\nThe CRAN repository features more than 20,000 packages that can be installed to expand the functionality of R almost indefinitely. Should none of them meet your needs, R gives you the tools to comfortably write and share your own functions and packages.",

Here is an example in the R programming language:\n\nprint(\"Hello world!\")\n\n[1] \"Hello world!\"\n\n\nEntering this command into your console and pressing ENTER will display the sentence “Hello world!” in a new line.\nAs we can see, anything that R should understand as a simple sequence of letters or words must be enclosed by quotation marks \"...\". Anything inside them will be interpreted as a so-called string. Their counterpart are numbers or integers, as illustrated here:\n\n2 + 2 - 1\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nNaturally, you can use R for more sophisticated computations:\n\n\\(2 + (3 \\times 3)\\)\n\n2 + (3 * 3)\n\n[1] 11\n\n\n\\(\\sqrt{9}\\)\n\nsqrt(9)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\\(\\frac{16}{2^3}\\)\n\n16 / 2 ^ 3\n\n[1] 2\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Working environment\nWhile it is certainly useful to print text or numbers to your console, it may sometimes make more sense to (at least temporally) store them somewhere, so you can re-use them later. In fact, R gives us a way of storing data in virtual, container-like objects: variables. We can assign strings or numbers to a variable by using the assignment operator &lt;-.\nWhen you run the commands below, you will (hopefully) notice two items popping up in your Environment/Workspace tab in the top right corner.\n\ngreeting &lt;- \"Hello world!\"\n\nquick_math &lt;- 2 + 2 - 1\n\nIf we now want to display the content in the console, we can simply apply the print() function to the variable:\n\nprint(greeting)\n\n[1] \"Hello world!\"\n\nprint(quick_math)\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nWe can also embed variables in other statements. For example, let’s take the content of quick_math and multiply it with 2.\n\nhard_math &lt;- quick_math * 2\n\nprint(hard_math)\n\n[1] 6\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 R Scripts\nWorking with the console has a very plain, yet important disadvantage: Once we close RStudio, the console is wiped clean, erasing everything we’ve typed into it during our precious R session.\nThe remedy for this nuisance are scripts. Essentially, a script is the programmer’s equivalent of a Word document: It allows you to save all the code you’ve written to a file, which you can seamlessly continue working on the next time you open it.\n\nTo create a new R script you can either go to:\n\n“File” \\(\\rightarrow\\) “New” \\(\\rightarrow\\) “R Script” or …\nclick on the icon with the + sign and select “R Script” …\nor simply press Ctrl+Shift+N (MacOS: Cmd+Shift+N)\n\n\nDon’t forget to save your script with Ctrl+S (Cmd+S)! It is good practice to save your files regularly.",

Quite conveniently, R happens to provide us with an abundance of plotting functions. To create a two-dimensional plot, we need to generate two objects in R: one for the individual lemmas and one for the frequency counts.\nLet’s combine the lemmas start, enjoy, begin and help using R’s c() function and store them in an object lemma. Enter the following line into a new R script and click on Run (or simply press Ctrl+Enter/Cmd+Enter).\n\nlemma &lt;- c(\"start\", \"enjoy\", \"begin\", \"help\")\n\nWe can now do the same for the frequency information:\n\nfrequency &lt;- c(418, 139, 337, 281)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen do I use quotation marks?\n\n\n\n\n\nLetters and numbers represent two distinct data types in R. Anything that should be understood as a simple sequence of letters must be enclosed by quotation marks \"...\". A linguistic item such as start will be will be evaluated as a string if it’s encoded as \"start\".\nNumbers (or integers), by contrast, appear without quotation marks.\n\n\n\nOur linguistic data is now stored in two variables lemma and frequency, which you can conceptualise as virtual container-like objects. These ‘containers’ are now showing in the Environment tab in the top right corner of your RStudio interface.\nThe combination of categorical labels and numeric information renders our data ideally suited for a barplot. R’s most basic barplot function (which is, unsurprisingly, called barplot()) needs at the very least …\n\na height argument, i.e., our y-axis values and\na names.arg argument, i.e., our x-axis labels.\n\n\nbarplot(frequency, names.arg = lemma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter some tinkering, our plot looks more presentable:\n\nbarplot(frequency, names.arg = lemma, \n        main = \"Frequency of Lemmas\", # title\n        xlab = \"Lemmas\",  # label for x-axis\n        ylab = \"Frequency\", # label for y-axis\n        col = \"steelblue\") # color\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does ‘#’ mean? On comments in R\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, everything followed by the hashtag # will be interpreted as a comment and won’t be evaluated by the R compiler. While comments don’t affect the output of our code in the slightest, they are crucial to any kind of programming project.\nAdding prose annotations will make your code not only easier to understand for others but also for your future self. Poor documentation is a common, yet unnecessary source of frustration for all parties involved …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, you now have the option to save the plot to your computer. Once the figure has appeared in your “Plots” panel, you can click on “Export” in the menu bar below and proceed to choose the desired output format and file directory.",

They form the cornerstone of various more complex objects such as data frames, and are essential to handling large data sets (e.g., corpora). And yet, vectors are very simple in that they are merely one-dimensional sequences of characters or numbers – no more, no less.\n\nprint(lemma)\n\n[1] \"start\" \"enjoy\" \"begin\" \"help\" \n\nprint(frequency)\n\n[1] 418 139 337 281\n\n\nThe individual elements in these two vectors are not randomly jumbling around in virtual space, but are in fact following a clear order. Each element comes with an “ID” (or index), by which it can be accessed. For example, if we want to print the first lemma in our lemma variable, we append square brackets [] to it. This will allow us to subset it.\n\nlemma[1]\n\n[1] \"start\"\n\n\nSimilarly, we can subset frequency according to, for example, its third element:\n\nfrequency[3]\n\n[1] 337\n\n\nIt is also possible to obtain entire ranges of elements, such as everything from the second to the fourth element:\n\nfrequency[2:4]\n\n[1] 139 337 281",

For instance, if we wanted to check whether they is in pp3 or not, we could use the handy notation below, returning a TRUE or FALSE value:\n\n\n\"they\" %in% pp3\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nAscertain whether the following items are in pp3:\n\nhim\n\n\nSolution:\n\"him\" %in% pp3 # TRUE\n\n\nyou\n\n\nSolution:\n\"you\" %in% pp3 # FALSE\n\n\nit and them\n\n\nSolution:\nc(\"it\", \"them\") %in% pp3 # TRUE TRUE\n\n\nwe, us and me\n\n\nSolution:\nc(\"we\", \"us\", \"them\") %in% pp3 # FALSE FALSE TRUE\n\n\n\n\nOnce we are sure that an element is in the vector of interest, another common problem that arises is finding its location.

The which() function returns the index of an element.\n\n\nwhich(pp3 == \"they\") # Note the two equal signs == !\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nYou can read this notation as “Which element in pp3 is they?”. The output suggests that is in position 6. Note that the number obtained depends on the order of elements you’ve chosen when creating pp3.\nNow, it’s your turn: Find the locations of it and them in pp3!\n\n\nSolution:\n# \"him\"\nwhich(pp3 == \"it\")\n\n# \"you\"\nwhich(pp3 == \"them\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWinter, Bodo. 2020.

Please install the following ones:\n\nquanteda (for the analysis of text data)\ntidyverse (a framework for data manipulation and visualisation)\nreadxl (for importing Microsoft Excel files)\nwritexl (for exporting Microsoft Excel files)\nkableExtra (for creating beautiful tables)\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Loading packages\nOnce the installation has been completed, you can proceed to load the libraries using the code below.

To re-activate a library, either use the library() function or simply select it in the Packages tab.\n\n\n\nIt is good practice to only activate those packages that are necessary for your analysis. While it won’t be a problem for the small set of packages as shown here, loading dozens of packages increases the risk of obtaining “homonymous” functions which have the same name but perform different operations. In this case, it might be helpful to “disambiguate” them by directly indicating which package a function is from:\n\nreadxl::read_xlsx(...)\n\n\n\n\n\nWinter, Bodo. 2020.

    "text": "12.1 Regular expressions\nRegular expressions (or ‘regex’) help us find more complex patterns in strings of text. Suppose we are interested in finding all inflectional forms of the lemma PROVIDE in a corpus, i.e., provide, provides, providing and provided. Insteading of searching for all forms individually, we can construct a regular expression of the form\n\\[\n\\text{provid(es | ing | ed)?}\n\\]which can be read as ‘Match the sequence of letters &lt;provide&gt; as well as when it is optionally followed by the letters &lt;s&gt; or &lt;ing&gt; or &lt;ed&gt;’. Notice how optionality is signified by the ‘?’ operator and alternatives by ‘|’.\nTo activate regular expression in a KWIC query, simply set the valuetype argument to \"regex\":\n\n# Load library and corpus\nlibrary(quanteda)\nICE_GB &lt;- readRDS(\"ICE_GB.RDS\")\n\n# Perform query\nkwic_provide &lt;- kwic(ICE_GB,\n                     phrase(\"provid(es|ing|ed)?\"),\n                     valuetype = \"regex\",\n                     window = 20)\n\nThe number of hits has more than doubled. However, upon closer inspection, we’ll notice a few false positives, namely providential, provider and providers:\n\ntable(kwic_provide$keyword)\n\n\n      provid      provide     provided     Provided    Provident providential \n           1          165          118            5            1            1 \n    provider    providers     provides    providing    Providing \n           1            3           72           52            1 \n\n\nThere are two ways to handle this:\n\nRefine the search expression further to only match those cases of interest.\nManually sort out irrelevant cases during annotation in your spreadsheet software.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, you should consider improving your search expression if you receive hundreds or even thousands of false hits. If there are only a couple of false positives, it’s usually easier to simply mark them as “irrelevant” in your spreadsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nHow could you refine the search expression for PROVIDE to get rid of the irrelevant cases? Consult the RegEX Cheatsheet below!\n\n\nSolution:\n# Add word boundary with \\\\b\nkwic_provide2 &lt;- kwic(ICE_GB,\n                     phrase(\"\\\\bprovid(e|es|ing|ed)\\\\b\"),\n                     valuetype = \"regex\",\n                     window = 20)\n\ntable(kwic_provide2$keyword)",

    "text": "14.3 Types of variables\nThe concept of the variable is very handy in that it enables us to quantify various aspects their observations.\nIn general, we distinguish between discrete variables, which can only take a limited set of unique values, and continuous variables, which can take infinitely many values within a specified range. We can further subdivide them into nominal, ordinal, interval-scaled and ratio-scaled variables:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNominal/categorical\n\n\n\n\n\nThese variables comprise a limited number of categories which cannot be ordered in a meaningful way. For instance, it does not matter which value of SUBORDTYPE or MORETHAN2CL comes first or last:\n\n    unique(cl.order$SUBORDTYPE)\n\n[1] \"temp\" \"caus\"\n\n    unique(cl.order$MORETHAN2CL)\n\n[1] \"no\"  \"yes\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdinal/categorical\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdinal variables are ordered. However, the intervals between their individual values are not interpretable. Heumann (2022: 6) provides a pertinent example:\n\n[T]he satisfaction with a product (unsatisfied–satisfied–very satisfied) is an ordinal variable because the values this variable can take can be ordered but the differences between ‘unsatisfied–satisfied’ and ‘satisfied–very satisfied’ cannot be compared in a numerical way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterval-scaled/continous\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of interval-scaled variables, the differences between the values can be interpreted, but their ratios must be treated with caution. A temperature of 4°C is 6 degrees warmer than -2°C; however, this does not imply that 4°C is three times warmer than -2°C. This is because the temperature scale has no true zero point; 0°C simply signifies another point on the scale and not the absence of temperature altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatio-scaled/continous\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatio-scaled variables allow both a meaningful interpretation of the differences between their values and (!) of the ratios between them. Within the context of clause length, LENGTH_DIFF values such as 4 and 8 not only suggest that the latter is four units greater than the former but also that their ratio \\(\\frac{8}{4} = 2\\) is a valid way to describe the relationship between these values. Here a LENGTH_DIFF of 0 can be clearly viewed as the absence of a length difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGries, Stefan Thomas. 2013.

The column names are followed by\n\nthe data type (num for numeric and chr for character strings)\nthe number of values (`[1:403]`) and\nthe first few observations.\n\nAnother intuitive way to display the structure of a data matrix is to simply show the first few rows:\n\nhead(cl.order)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 8\n   CASE ORDER SUBORDTYPE LEN_MC LEN_SC LENGTH_DIFF CONJ     MORETHAN2CL\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;chr&gt;      \n1  4777 sc-mc temp            4     10          -6 als/when no         \n2  1698 mc-sc temp            7      6           1 als/when no         \n3   953 sc-mc temp           12      7           5 als/when yes        \n4  1681 mc-sc temp            6     15          -9 als/when no         \n5  4055 sc-mc temp            9      5           4 als/when yes        \n6   967 sc-mc temp            9      5           4 als/when yes        \n\n\n\n15.2.1 Frequency tables\n\n15.2.1.1 One variable\nEach categorical variable is made up of two or more categories. A simple descriptive measure is the frequency of each category.

For example, what is the distribution of clause order depending on the type of subordinate clause?\n\norder_counts1 &lt;- table(cl.order$ORDER, cl.order$SUBORDTYPE)\n\nprint(order_counts1)\n\n       \n        caus temp\n  mc-sc  184   91\n  sc-mc   15  113\n\n\nHere is the xtabs() alternative:\n\norder_counts2 &lt;- xtabs(~ ORDER + SUBORDTYPE, cl.order)\n\nprint(order_counts2)\n\n       SUBORDTYPE\nORDER   caus temp\n  mc-sc  184   91\n  sc-mc   15  113\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do I obtain percentages?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to convert the raw frequency counts to percentage tables:\n\nManually divide all cells by the total number of observations (which correspond to the sum of all cells) and multiply the result by 100.\n\n\npct1 &lt;- order_counts1/sum(order_counts1) * 100\n\n\nUse the prop.table() function and multiply the result by 100.\n\n\npct2 &lt;- prop.table(order_counts1) * 100",

Consider a continuous variable \\(X\\) with observations \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\) from a sample of size \\(n\\). The sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) then corresponds to\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n} \\\\ = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold on, what does this large Σ symbol mean?\n\n\n\nThe summation symbol \\(\\sum\\) is a concise way to express the sum of a sequence of numbers. It works like this:\n\nThe expression below the \\(\\sum\\) (e.g., \\(i = 1\\)) indicates the starting value of the index \\(i\\).\nThe number above the \\(\\sum\\) (e.g., \\(n\\)) is the ending value of the index \\(i\\).\nThe expression to the right of the \\(\\sum\\) (e.g., \\(x_i\\)) is the term to be summed.\n\nFor instance, the expression \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\\) means “sum the values of \\(x_i\\) starting from \\(i = 1\\) up to \\(i = n\\).” In other words, it adds up the values \\(x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n\\).\n\n\nIn R, we can obtain the average value of a numeric vector with the mean() function. Let’s do that for the length of main clauses found in the cl.order data:\n\n# Using mean()\nmean(cl.order$LEN_MC)\n\n[1] 9.265509\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompute the sample mean by hand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmean &lt;- 1/length(cl.order$LEN_MC) * sum(cl.order$LEN_MC)\n\n\n\n\nThe output returned by this function provides a one-value summary of all observations contained in LEN_MC. How could we visualise it?\nFirst, let’s create a histogram of LEN_MC. Histograms summarise how often certain values occur in a continuous variable. The blue line indicates the sample mean.

    "text": "17.1 The normal distribution\nA great number of numerical variables in the world follow the well-known normal (or Gaussian) distribution, which includes test scores, weight and height, among many others.\nIf a random variable \\(X\\) is normally distributed, it is determined by the parameters \\(\\mu\\) (the mean) and \\(\\sigma\\) (the standard deviation). Formally, we can summarise this using the notation\n\\[ X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2).\\] The probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution has a characteristic bell-shape. The density values on the \\(y\\)-axis indicate the likelihood of encountering a specific value of \\(X\\) (cf. Winter 2020: 56; Heumann, Schomaker, and Shalabh 2022: 173-177).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.1.1 Bernoulli distribution\nThe Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution for random variables which have only two possible outcomes: “positive” (often coded as 1) and “negative” (often coded as 0). Examples of such variables include coin tosses (heads/tails), binary response questions (yes/no), and defect status (defective/non-defective).\nIf a random variable \\(X\\) follows a Bernoulli distribution, it is determined by the parameter \\(p\\), which is the probability of the positive case:\n\\[ X \\sim Bernoulli(p).\\] The probability mass function (PMF) of the Bernoulli distribution is given by: \\[\nP(X = x) =\n\\begin{cases}\np & \\text{if } x = 1 \\\\\n1 - p & \\text{if } x = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(0 \\leq p \\leq 1\\). This function shows the probability of \\(X\\) taking on the value of 1 or 0 (cf. Heumann, Schomaker, and Shalabh 2022: 162-163).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtensions\n\n\n\nA Bernoulli experiment presupposes a single trial (e.g., tossing a coin once). If we are interested in the distribution of a binary discrete variable over \\(n\\) Bernoulli trials, we can describe it in terms of the binomial distribution (Heumann, Schomaker, and Shalabh 2022: 163-166).\nCategorical variables with more than 2 outcomes and \\(n\\) Bernoulli trials can be modelled using the multinomial distribution (Heumann, Schomaker, and Shalabh 2022: 167-169).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeumann, Christian, Michael Schomaker, and Shalabh. 2022.

    "text": "17.2 Hypothesis testing\nThe first step is to define the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) and the alternative hypothesis \\(H_1\\) (or \\(H_a\\)).\nGiven two categorical variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), we assume under \\(H_0\\) that both variables are independent from each other. This hypothesis describes the “default state of the world” (James et al. 2021: 555), i.e., what we would usually expect to see. By contrast, the alternative hypothesis \\(H_1\\) states that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are not independent, i.e., that \\(H_0\\) does not hold.\nIn this unit, we will consider two scenarios:\n\nWe are interested in finding out whether English clause ORDER (‘sc-mc’ or ‘mc-sc’) depends on the type of the subordinate clause (SUBORDTYPE), which can be either temporal (‘temp’) or causal (‘caus’).\n\nOur hypotheses are:\n\n\\(H_0:\\) The variables ORDER and SUBORDTYPE are independent.\n\\(H_1:\\) The variables ORDER and SUBORDTYPE are not independent.\n\n\nAs part of a phonetic study, we compare the base frequencies of the F1 formants for male and female speakers of Apache. We forward the following hypotheses:\n\n\n\\(H_0:\\) mean F1 frequency of men \\(=\\) mean F1 frequency of women.\n\\(H_1:\\) mean F1 frequency of men \\(\\ne\\) mean F1 frequency of women.\n\nBased on our data, we can decide to either accept or reject \\(H_0\\). Rejecting \\(H_0\\) can be viewed as evidence in favour of \\(H_1\\) and thus marks a potential ‘discovery’ in the data. However, there is always a chance that we accept or reject the wrong hypothesis; the four possible constellations are summarised in the table below (cf. Heumann, Schomaker, and Shalabh 2022: 223):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_0\\) is true\n\\(H_0\\) is not true\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_0\\) is not rejected\n\\(\\color{green}{\\text{Correct decision}}\\)\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Type II } (\\beta)\\text{-error}}\\)\n\n\n\\(H_0\\) is rejected\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Type I } (\\alpha)\\text{-error}}\\)\n\\(\\color{green}{\\text{Correct decision}}\\)\n\n\n\nThe probability of a Type I error, which refers to the rejection of \\(H_0\\) although it is true, is called the significance level \\(\\alpha\\), which has a conventional value of \\(0.05\\) (i.e., a 5% chance of committing a Type I error).",

For instance, the Pearson \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic is commonly used for categorical variables.\nIt requires two types of values: the observed frequencies \\(n_{ij}\\) in our data set and the expected frequencies \\(m_{ij}\\), which we would expect to see if \\(H_0\\) were true. The indices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) uniquely identify the frequencies found in all column-row combinations of a cross-table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical details: The structure of a contingency table\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below represents a generic contingency table where \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are categorical variables. Each \\(x_i\\) represents a category of \\(X\\) and each \\(y_j\\) represents a category of \\(Y\\).

    "text": "21.4 Linear Regression\nLinear regression is a simple approach to supervised machine learning where the response variable is known. It assumes that the dependence of \\(Y\\) on \\(X\\) is linear. This approach is suitable for numerical response variables. The predictors, however, can be either numerical or discrete/categorical. Although it may seem overly simplistic, linear regression is extremely useful both conceptually and practically.\n\n21.4.1 Model with a single predictor \\(X\\)\nA linear model of our data would have the form\n\\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X + \\epsilon \\]\nor, in more concrete terms,\n\\[ \\text{Reaction time} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Frequency} + \\text{Model Error,} \\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are two unknown constants that represent the intercept and slope of the regression line, respectively. Together they are referred to as the model coefficients (or parameters), and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term. The fact that assumptions are made about the form of the model renders it a parametric model.\nGiven the existing data on \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), which is also known as the training data, we estimate the model coefficients \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). While we use the training data to estimate these coefficients, we cannot know the true values of the coefficients, i.e., the exact true relationship between the variables. Their tentative nature is indicated by the hat symbol ^ above them: \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\) and \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow are the coefficients estimated?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most common way of estimating parameters for linear models is the Least Squares approach. In essence, the parameters are chosen such that the residual sum of squares, i.e., the sum of the differences between observed and predicted values, is as low as possible. More formally, the estimated slope then corresponds to\n\\[ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i- \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}(x_i- \\bar{x})^2}.\\]\nNow we can obtain the intercept:\n\\[\n\\hat{\\beta_0}= \\bar{y}- \\hat{\\beta}_1\\bar{x}\n\\]\n\n\n\nWe can then predict future sales using the formula\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1x,\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{y}\\) indicates a prediction of \\(Y\\) on the basis of the predictor values \\(X = x\\).\nIn R, we can fit a linear model with the lm() function.\n\n# Fit linear model\n\nrt.lm1 = lm(log(RT) ~ log(Freq), data = ELP)\n\n# View model data\n\nsummary(rt.lm1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = log(RT) ~ log(Freq), data = ELP)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.29765 -0.08203 -0.01205  0.07298  0.43407 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

    "text": "21.6 Model assumptions and diagnostics\nAs a parametric method, linear regression makes numerous assumptions about the training data. It is, therefore, essential to run further tests to rule out possible violations. Among other things, the model assumptions include:\n\nA linear relationship between the response and the quantitative predictors: The residuals should not display a clear pattern. For this reason, it is recommended to use component residual plots (e.g., crPlot() from the car library) for the visual identification of potentially non-linear trends.\nNo heteroscedasticity (i.e, non-constant variance of error terms): Visually, a violation of this assumption becomes apparent if the residuals form a funnel-like shape. It is also possible to conduct a non-constant variance test ncvTest(): If it returns \\(p\\)-values &lt; 0.05, this suggests non-constant variance.\nNo multicollinearity: Predictors should not be correlated with each other. In the model data, correlated variables have unusually high standard errors, thereby decreasing the explanatory power of both the coefficients and the model as a whole. Another diagnostic measure are variance inflation factors (VIF-scores); predictors with VIF scores &gt; 5 are potentially collinear. They can be computed using the vif() function.\nNormally distributed residuals: The residuals should follow the normal distribution. Usually, a visual inspection using qqnorm() is sufficient, but the Shapiro-Wilke test shapiro.test() can also be run on the model residuals. Note that a \\(p\\)-value below 0.05 provides evidence for non-normality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nBeside the points mentioned above, it is always recommend to examine the model with regard to\n\noutliers that might skew the regression estimates,\ninteractions, i.e., combined effects of predictors, and\noverfitting, which results in poor model performance outside the training data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeumann, Christian, Michael Schomaker, and Shalabh. 2022.

    "text": "22.3 Logistic regression\n\nIn contrast to linear regression, logistic regression models a qualitative response variable \\(Y\\) (here: Reference) with two outcomes as a function of the independent variables \\(X_p\\) (Register, Variety etc.). The goal is to predict a value for \\(Y\\).\nFor a given observation, the model should predict either a specific category of \\(Y\\) (e.g., Reference = overt or Reference = null) or provide a probability estimation of a particular outcome (e.g., the probability of Reference = null).\nThe probability that Reference = null given a predictor (e.g., Register) can be written as \\(P(\\text{Reference} = \\text{null} \\mid \\text{Register})\\) or more simply as \\(p(\\text{Register})\\).\nA core component of logistic regression is the logistic function. The rationale for using it is that the output of the function will always lie between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), and it will always denote a probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.3.1 The logistic model\nAssuming a binary response variable \\(Y\\) with the values 1 and 0 and a single predictor \\(X\\), we can model the probability \\(P(Y = 1\\vert X) = p(X)\\) as\n\\[\np(X) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X}}.\n\\]\nNote that \\(e \\approx 2.71828\\). This expression is equivalent to\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X.\n\\]\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)}\\) represents the odds, which stand for to the probability of one outcome (e.g., Reference = null) compared to the other (e.g., Reference = overt). Their logarithmic transformation are the log odds (or logits) of a model. When interpreting the output of a logistic model, note that\n\npositive log odds indicate an increase in \\(p(X)\\), whereas\nnegative log odds indicate a decrease in \\(p(X)\\).\n\nIf \\(X = \\text{Register}\\), then our model has the form:\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{P(\\text{Reference} = \\text{null} \\mid \\text{Register})}{1- P(\\text{Reference} = \\text{null} \\mid \\text{Register})}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Register}\n\\]\n\n\n22.3.2 Multiple logistic regression\nIf more than one predictor is included, the above equations can be expanded so as to take into account \\(p\\) slopes \\(\\beta_p\\) for \\(p\\) independent variables \\(X_p\\).\n\\[\np(X) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + ... +  \\beta_pX_p}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + ... + \\beta_pX_p}}.\n\\] Thus, the log odds correspond to the sum of \\(\\beta_pX_p\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log\\left(\\frac{p(X)}{1-p(X)}\\right) &= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + ... +  \\beta_pX_p \\\\\n& = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\beta_i X_i\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] respectively.\n\n\n22.3.3 Odds ratios\nTo assess the strength of an effect, it is instructive to examine the odds ratios that correspond to the model coefficients. Odds ratios (OR) are defined as\n\\[\nOR(X_1) = e^{\\beta_1}.\n\\]\nEssentially, the OR describes the ratio between two odds with respect to another independent variable. This is illustrated for Reference given Register below:\n\\[\n\\text{OR}(\\text{Reference} \\mid \\text{Register}) = \\frac{\\frac{P(\\text{Reference} = \\text{null} \\mid \\text{Register} = \\text{S1A})}{P(\\text{Reference} = \\text{overt} \\mid \\text{Register} = \\text{S1A})}}{\\frac{P(\\text{Reference} = \\text{null} \\mid \\text{Register} = \\text{S1B})}{P(\\text{Reference} = \\text{overt} \\mid \\text{Register} = \\text{S1B})}}\n\\] Read as: ‘The ratio between the probability of a null vs. overt object in S1A and the probability of a null vs. overt object in S1B’.",

    "text": "22.4 Workflow in R\n\n22.4.1 Step 1: Research question and hypotheses\nHow do the intra- and extra-linguistic variables suggested in the literature affect subject pronoun realisation (Definite Null Instantiation) in British English, Singapore English and Hong Kong English?\nGiven a significance level \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\), the hypotheses are: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_0: & \\quad \\text{None of the predictor coefficients deviate from 0}.\\\\\nH_1: & \\quad \\text{At least one predictor coefficient deviates from 0}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThese can be restated mathematically as:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_0: & \\quad \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\cdots = \\beta_p = 0 \\\\\nH_1: & \\quad \\text{At least one } \\beta_i \\neq 0 \\text{ for } i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, p\\}\n\\end{aligned} \\]\n\n\n22.4.2 Step 2: Convert to factors and specify reference levels\nThe next step involves specifying reference levels for all categorical variables. This step is very important because it will directly impact the parameter estimation and, consequently, influence our interpretation of the model output.\n\nThe reference level of the response is usually chosen such that it corresponds to the unmarked or most frequent case. Since overt pronouns are much more common in the data, the reference level of the Reference variable will be set to Reference = overt. This way, the model coefficients will directly represent the probability of the null subject variant (i.e., the special case) given certain predictor configurations.\nThe predictor levels need to be specified as well. Among other things, we are interested in how the Asian Englishes pattern relative to British English. Therefore, we will define British English as the baseline for comparison.\n\nWe will use the following specifications:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nFactor Levels\nPreferred Reference level\n\n\n\n\nRegister\nS1A, S1B\nS1A\n\n\nVariety\nGB, SING, HK\nGB\n\n\nPerson\n1, 2, 3, it, there\n3\n\n\nReferentiality\nreferential, non-referential\nreferential\n\n\n\n\n# Store \"Reference\" as factor\ndata_pro$Reference &lt;- as.factor(data_pro$Reference)\n\n## Specify reference level (the 'unmarked' case)\ndata_pro$Reference &lt;- relevel(data_pro$Reference, \"overt\")\n\n## Print levels\nlevels(data_pro$Reference)\n\n[1] \"overt\" \"null\" \n\n\nRepeat the procedure for the remaining categorical variables.\n\n\nCode\n# Store \"Register\" as factor\ndata_pro$Register &lt;- as.factor(data_pro$Register)\n\n## Specify reference level\ndata_pro$Register &lt;- relevel(data_pro$Register, \"S1A\")\n\n# Store \"Variety\" as factor\ndata_pro$Variety &lt;- as.factor(data_pro$Variety)\n\n## Specify reference level\ndata_pro$Variety &lt;- relevel(data_pro$Variety, \"GB\")\n\n# Store \"Person\" as factor\ndata_pro$Person &lt;- as.factor(data_pro$Person)\n\n## Specify reference level\ndata_pro$Person &lt;- relevel(data_pro$Person, \"3\")\n\n# Store \"Referentiality\" as factor\ndata_pro$Referentiality &lt;- as.factor(data_pro$Referentiality)\n\n## Specify reference level\ndata_pro$Referentiality &lt;- relevel(data_pro$Referentiality, \"referential\")\n\n\n\n\n22.4.3 Step 3: Fit the model\nThere are two functions that can fit logistic models in R: lrm() and glm().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe model formula below does not include Referentiality because several intermediary steps revealed it to be almost completely irrelevant for predicting Reference.

The nodes of a tree represent variables, the branches represent decision rules, and leaf nodes indicate the final outcome (e.g., a prediction).\nCART: The original computational implementation of decision trees is known as the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm developed by Breiman (1984).\n\n\n22.2.1 Classification trees\nIf we are dealing with a categorical response variable, the tree() function can be used to fit a classification tree in accordance with Breiman’s CART algorithm. For illustration, consider the tv data frame. We will model the choice of the pronoun Form based on the speaker’s and hearer’s social circle (Rel_Circle) and their difference in social class (Rel_Class).\n\n# Set random number generator for reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Supply model formula\ntree.tv &lt;- tree(Form ~ Rel_Circle + Rel_Class, data = tv)\n\n# View tree statistics\nsummary(tree.tv)\n\n\nClassification tree:\ntree(formula = Form ~ Rel_Circle + Rel_Class, data = tv)\nNumber of terminal nodes:  9 \nResidual mean deviance:  0.974 = 213.3 / 219 \nMisclassification error rate: 0.2412 = 55 / 228 \n\n# Visualisation\nplot(tree.tv)\n\ntext(tree.tv, pretty = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important problem that arises during tree construction is that of split selection. When should the tree split a node into two further nodes and when not? Furthermore, when should the tree stop the splitting process entirely? In this respect, CART relies on the principle of impurity reduction: “The fundamental idea is to select each split of a subset so that the data in each of the descendent subsets are ‘purer’ than the data in the parent subset” (Breiman 1984: 23). A measure for node purity is the Gini index \\(G\\), which is defined as\n\\[\nG = \\sum_{k=1}^{K}{\\hat{p}_{mk}(1-\\hat{p}_{mk}),}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{p}_{mk}\\) measures the proportion of observations of a response level \\(k\\) in the \\(m\\)th prediction area of the training data set. Values close to 0 are indicative of high node purity, meaning that most observations belong to the same class (e.g., Form = ty). If splitting a node no longer leads to a substantial increase in purity, it becomes the terminal node, i.e., it is not split further. This terminal node returns the tree’s class prediction.\nIt is worth noting that modern CART implementations rely on different splitting criteria. For instance, Conditional Inference Trees use the \\(p\\) values of internal association tests to identify which variables warrant further subdivision of the training data. The presence or absence of correlation thus also determines whether or not a given node will be terminal (for more details, see Greenwell 2022: 122).\n\n# Fitting a conditional inference tree\nctree.tv &lt;- ctree(Form ~ ., data = tv) # dot . means 'include all predictors'\n\nplot(ctree.tv)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.2.2 Regression trees\nRegression trees are used for continuous response variables. Instead of providing class predictions, they return the mean value of observations in a given prediction area. The algorithm now strives to minimize the residual sum of squares (\\(RSS\\); cf. footnote 1 in 8. Linear Regression).

    "text": "22.3 Random forests\nRandom forests (Breiman 2001) belong to the class of ensemble methods because they combine simpler models (e.g., individual decision trees) into a more complex and possibly more accurate model. As part of the RF algorithm, a great number of decision trees is trained on bootstrapped samples of the training data.\nSo far, random forests are essentially identical with Bagging (= bootstrap aggregation); however, an important additional characteristic of the RF algorithm is that only a random subset of the predictors is taken into consideration at each split. According to (Strobl, Malley, and Tutz 2009: 332), the resulting variability in tree structure is advantageous: “By combining the prediction of such a diverse set of trees, ensemble methods utilize the fact that classification trees are unstable, but, on average, produce the right prediction”.\n\n22.3.1 Regression forest\nFor regression tasks, random forests return the average prediction of all trees in the ensemble.\n\n# For regression\nrt.rf.reg &lt;- randomForest(RT ~ Length + Freq + POS, data = ELP,\n                                mtry = 1, # = sqrt(number of variables)\n                                ntree = 500) # number of trees\n\nrt.rf.reg\n\n\nCall:\n randomForest(formula = RT ~ Length + Freq + POS, data = ELP,      mtry = 1, ntree = 500) \n               Type of random forest: regression\n                     Number of trees: 500\nNo. of variables tried at each split: 1\n\n          Mean of squared residuals: 8972.927\n                    % Var explained: 43.64\n\n# Conditional random forest\nrt.crf.reg &lt;- cforest(RT ~ Length + Freq + POS, data = ELP, \n                    controls = cforest_unbiased(ntree = 500, mtry = 1))\n\n\n\n22.3.2 Classification forest\nFor classification, all trees cast a vote for one of the response classes. The OOB error estimate refers to the accuracy of out-of-bag (OOB) predictions. After the initial bootstrapping procedure, roughly a third of the training data remains unused. These observations, which were not used for fitting trees, can be used as a test data set. Predictions based on this internal test data set are called OOB predictions.\n\n# For classification\ntv.rf.class &lt;- randomForest(Form ~ ., data = tv,\n                            mtry = 4,\n                            ntree = 500)\n\ntv.rf.class\n\n\nCall:\n randomForest(formula = Form ~ ., data = tv, mtry = 4, ntree = 500) \n               Type of random forest: classification\n                     Number of trees: 500\nNo. of variables tried at each split: 4\n\n        OOB estimate of  error rate: 18.86%\nConfusion matrix:\n   ty vy class.error\nty 86 22   0.2037037\nvy 21 99   0.1750000\n\n# Conditional random forest\ntv.crf.class &lt;- cforest(Form ~ ., data = tv,\n                    controls = cforest_unbiased(ntree = 500, mtry = 4))\n\ntv.crf.class\n\n\n     Random Forest using Conditional Inference Trees\n\nNumber of trees:  500 \n\nResponse:  Form \nInputs:  Film, Rel_Age, Rel_Sex, Rel_Power, Rel_Circle, S_Class, H_Class, S_Age, H_Age, Rel_Class, Before68, Others, Office, S_Sex, H_Sex, Place \nNumber of observations:  228 \n\n\n\n\n22.3.3 Variable importance\nRandom forests allow users to assess whether or not certain predictors are useful for the model. The Gini index can be re-used to identify those variables that have led to the greatest reduction in impurity. However, this measure is biased towards predictors with many values (cf. Strobl et al. 2007).\n\n# Gini importance (Reaction times)\nvarImpPlot(rt.rf.reg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Gini importance (Form of 2.p.)\nvarImpPlot(tv.rf.class)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more robust measures is (Conditional) Permutation Accuracy Importance which compares the predictive accuracy of the random forest model before and after randomly permuting the values of the predictors (cf.

    "text": "13.2 Sample study\n\n13.2.1 Theoretical background\nLet’s assume we are interested in the object realisation patterns of the verb eat in the British ICE component. A quick review of the literature tells us that …\n\n… argument realisation may be related to the aspectual structure of a verbal action (cf. Goldberg 2001), but …\n… there is a stronger focus on situation aspect (telicity/atelicity; i.e., logical endpoints of actions) than on grammatical aspect (i.e., perfective/progressive).\n\nSince grammatical aspect is also concerned with the temporal construal of actions, it raises the question of whether or not it can also influence object realisation. To investigate the relationship between aspect and object realisation, we will perform an exemplary analysis on the verb lemma EAT.\n\n\n13.2.2 Obtaining data\nWe load all necessary libraries to query the ICE-GB corpus and run a KWIC-search using the regular expression \\\\b(eat(s|ing|en)?|ate)\\\\b, which finds all inflection forms of EAT. We then store the results in a spreadsheet file kwic_eat.xlsx.\n\n# Load library and corpus\nlibrary(quanteda)\nlibrary(writexl)\n\nICE_GB &lt;- readRDS(\"ICE_GB.RDS\")\n\n# Perform query\nkwic_eat &lt;- kwic(ICE_GB,\n          phrase(\"\\\\b(eat(s|ing|en)?|ate)\\\\b\"),\n          valuetype = \"regex\",\n          window = 15)\n\n# Store results\nwrite_xlsx(kwic_eat, \"kwic_eat.xlsx\")\n\nWhen you open kwic_eat.xlsx in a spreadsheet software, the file will contain 7 columns by default (docname, from, to, keyword, post, pattern). Each row corresponds to a match of your search expression in the corpus, which is equal to 113 here. This is your raw output.",

    "text": "13.3 Data annotation\nWhenever you decide to work on your corpus results, it is good practice to duplicate your file and append the current date to the filename. Re-save it as, for instance, kwic_eat_09_09_2024.xlsx and open it again. This way you’re performing basic version control, which will allow you to return to previous stages of your analysis with ease.\nIn your spreadsheet software, you can now assign your variables of interest to the empty columns next to your output data. For our specific example, we will need one that captures object realisation and one the type of verb aspect. Let’s simply call them object_realisation and verb_aspect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNaming variables\n\n\n\nOf course, you could also opt for a different column name, as long it has no spaces or special characters (e.g., !?%#). You could also name it object_realisation or, even more plainly, object, but not direct object or object realisation with spaces. Otherwise you are bound to encounter a surge of cryptic error messages in your R console.\n\n\nNow, you are ready to annotate your data! An easy coding scheme would involve classifying rows where eat occurs with an object as yes. Conversely, rows where the direct object is not realised syntactically are assigned the column value no. In the aspect column, verbal aspect will be coded as either perfective, progressive or neutral, following S. Gries and Deshors (2014): 118.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.1 Dealing with problematic cases\nHowever, things are not always that clear-cut. What if you encounter a false positive, i.e., an erroneous hit in your dataset? Further down in the spreadsheet the keyword ate is actually part of the preceding word, inappropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocname\nfrom\nto\npre\nkeyword\npost\npattern\n\n\n\n\n113\nICE_GB/W2F-019.txt\n696\n696\n: 1 &gt; Too much colour on her face would be inappropri &lt; l &gt;\nate\n, she feels , but she wears a light foundation . &lt; ICE-GB:W2F-019 #28 :\n\\b(eat(s|ing|en)?|ate)\\b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do I do with false hits?\n\n\n\nShort answer: Do not delete irrelevant rows or columns. Essentially, from the moment you’ve obtained your corpus output, you should withstand the temptation to delete anything from it. Instead, adopt the practice of indicating missing values or irrelevant rows by an NA in a separate column. In later analyses, these can be easily filtered out!\nThis also minimises the risk of accidentally getting rid of data that could have proven important at a later point in time.\n\n\n\n\n13.3.2 Getting the data back into R\nImport the Excel file via\n\n# Load library\nlibrary(readxl)\n\n# Read file contents into the variable \"kwic_data\"\nkwic_data &lt;- read_xlsx(\"kwic_eat_09_09_2024.xlsx\")\n\n# Print the first six lines of \"kwic_data\"\nprint(head(kwic_data))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 9\n  docname  from    to pre   keyword post  pattern object_realisation aspect_verb\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;      \n1 ICE_GB…   458   458 had … eaten   anyw… \"\\\\b(e… no                 perfective \n2 ICE_GB…   478   478 : 1 … eating  will… \"\\\\b(e… no                 progressive\n3 ICE_GB…   785   785 &gt; Ye… eat     befo… \"\\\\b(e… no                 neutral    \n4 ICE_GB…  1198  1198 the … eat     them… \"\\\\b(e… yes                neutral    \n5 ICE_GB…  4529  4529 &gt; Ye… ate     in t… \"\\\\b(e… no                 neutral    \n6 ICE_GB…   958   958 know… eat     it f… \"\\\\b(e… yes                neutral    \n\n\n\n\n13.3.3 Adding a case list\nS. T. Gries (2013) recommends setting up the first column of the data frame such that it “numbers all n cases from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\) so that every row can be uniquely identified and so that you always restore one particular ordering (e.g., the original one)” (S. T. Gries 2013: 26). This is very easy to do: We specify a numeric vector ranging from 1 to the total number of rows in the data frame.\n\n# Create a new Case column (which, by default, is moved to the very end of the data frame)\nkwic_data$Case &lt;- 1:nrow(kwic_data)\n\n# Move the Case column to the front of the data frame\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nkwic_data &lt;- relocate(kwic_data, Case)\n\n# Print reordered data frame\nprint(head(kwic_data))\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n   Case docname        from    to pre   keyword post  pattern object_realisation\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;             \n1     1 ICE_GB/S1A-0…   458   458 had … eaten   anyw… \"\\\\b(e… no                \n2     2 ICE_GB/S1A-0…   478   478 : 1 … eating  will… \"\\\\b(e… no                \n3     3 ICE_GB/S1A-0…   785   785 &gt; Ye… eat     befo… \"\\\\b(e… no                \n4     4 ICE_GB/S1A-0…  1198  1198 the … eat     them… \"\\\\b(e… yes               \n5     5 ICE_GB/S1A-0…  4529  4529 &gt; Ye… ate     in t… \"\\\\b(e… no                \n6     6 ICE_GB/S1A-0…   958   958 know… eat     it f… \"\\\\b(e… yes               \n# ℹ 1 more variable: aspect_verb &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoldberg, Adele E. 2001. “Patient Arguments of Causative Verbs Can Be Omitted: The Role of Information Structure in Argument Distribution.” Language Sciences 23 (4): 503–24.\n\n\nGries, Stefan Thomas. 2013.

    "text": "14.3 Variables\nThe concept of the variable is very handy in that it allows us to quantify various aspects their observations. In general, we distinguish between discrete variables, which can only take a limited set of unique values, and continuous variables, which can take infinitely many values within a specified range.\n\n14.3.1 Subtypes\nWe can further subdivide discrete and continuous variables into into nominal, ordinal, interval-scaled and ratio-scaled ones:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNominal/categorical\n\n\n\n\n\nThese variables comprise a limited number of categories which cannot be ordered in a meaningful way. For instance, it does not matter which value of SUBORDTYPE or MORETHAN2CL comes first or last:\n\n    unique(cl.order$SUBORDTYPE)\n\n[1] \"temp\" \"caus\"\n\n    unique(cl.order$MORETHAN2CL)\n\n[1] \"no\"  \"yes\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdinal/categorical\n\n\n\n\n\nOrdinal variables are ordered. However, the intervals between their individual values are not interpretable. Heumann (2022: 6) provides a pertinent example:\n\n[T]he satisfaction with a product (unsatisfied–satisfied–very satisfied) is an ordinal variable because the values this variable can take can be ordered but the differences between ‘unsatisfied–satisfied’ and ‘satisfied–very satisfied’ cannot be compared in a numerical way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterval-scaled/continous\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case of interval-scaled variables, the differences between the values can be interpreted, but their ratios must be treated with caution. A temperature of 4°C is 6 degrees warmer than -2°C; however, this does not imply that 4°C is three times warmer than -2°C. This is because the temperature scale has no true zero point; 0°C simply signifies another point on the scale and not the absence of temperature altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatio-scaled/continous\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRatio-scaled variables allow both a meaningful interpretation of the differences between their values and (!) of the ratios between them. Within the context of clause length, LENGTH_DIFF values such as 4 and 8 not only suggest that the latter is four units greater than the former but also that their ratio \\(\\frac{8}{4} = 2\\) is a valid way to describe the relationship between these values. Here a LENGTH_DIFF of 0 can be clearly viewed as the absence of a length difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.3.2 Dependent vs. independent variables\nIn empirical studies, it is often of interest whether one variable leads to changes in the values of another variable. When exploring such associations, we need to take another heuristic step to clarify the direction of the influence.\nIn a linguistic context, we denote the variable whose usage patterns we’d like to explain as the dependent or response variable. A list of possible dependent variables is provided in the section on Linguistic variables).\nIts outcomes are said to depend on one or more independent variables. These are also often referred to as explanatory variables as they are supposed to explain variation in the response variable. These can be age, sex or the variety of English at hand.\n\n\n14.3.3 Exercises\n\nClassify the remaining variables in the cl.order dataset.\nConsider the following statement:\n\n\nThis paper examines the influence of clause length on the ordering of main and subordinate clauses.\n\nWhat is the dependent variable?
