    "text": "Preface\nThis collection of handouts provides a hands-on introduction to data analysis and statistical methods in quantitative corpus linguistics with R. It is designed with accessibility in mind, assuming no prior knowledge of programming or statistics. All you need to get started is a laptop; everything else will be explained within these pages.\nPrimarily, this reader is geared towards students attending the classes Language Variation (BA) and Statistics for Linguistics (MA) at the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt (Germany). However, it is also meant to equip students currently working on their BA/MA/PhD theses with the tools they need to conduct empirical studies on a wide array of linguistic phenomena. The methods presented here reflect the state-of-the-art in corpus-linguistic research, providing readers with current and relevant analytical techniques.",

The second section introduces R as an analytical tool, covering its core functionality. With these fundamentals in place, we proceed to query corpora directly within R. Chapters four and five focus on describing discrete and continuous outputs, as well as identifying meaningful associations and differences in the data (BA). Finally, to gain more nuanced insights into potential patterns, we apply common machine learning algorithms to fit, evaluate, and interpret statistical models (MA).\nThroughout this journey, readers will develop the skills to conduct robust corpus-linguistic analyses, from basic querying to advanced statistical modeling.",

    "text": "17.2 Continuous distributions\n\n17.2.1 The normal distribution\nA great number of numerical variables in the world follow the well-known normal (or Gaussian) distribution, which includes test scores, weight and height, among many others. The plot below illustrates its characteristic bell-shape: Most observations are in the middle, with considerably fewer near the fringes. For example, most people are rather “average” in height; there are only few people that are extremely short or extremely tall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe normal distribution is typically described in terms of two parameters: The population mean \\(\\mu\\) and the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). If a random variable \\(X\\) is normally distributed, we typically use the notation in Equation 17.1.\n\\[ X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2).\n\\tag{17.1}\\]\nThe Gaussian bell curve has several interesting properties:\n\n68% all values fall within one standard deviation of the mean,\n95% within two, and\n99.7% within three.\n\nBelow, you can see the annotated probability density function (PDF) of the normal distribution. The \\(y\\)-axis indicates the density of population values; note that since the Gaussian distribution is a continuous distribution, the probability of any given value is 0. We can only obtain probabilities for intervals of values, which are given by\n\\[\nP(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_a^b f(x)dx.\n\\tag{17.2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can find the population mean of \\(X\\) with a PDF \\(f(x)\\) via\n\\[\nE(X) = \\mu = \\int_x xf(x)dx,\n\\tag{17.3}\\]\nwhere \\(E(X)\\) denotes the expected value of \\(X\\), i.e., the mean. Essentially, multiplying every value \\(x\\) by its respective probability density \\(f(x)\\) and integrating over all possible values of \\(x\\) will return \\(E(X) = \\mu\\).",

    "text": "17.3 Discrete distributions\n\n17.3.1 Bernoulli distribution\nThe Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution for random variables which have only two possible outcomes: “positive” (often coded as 1) and “negative” (often coded as 0). Examples of such variables include coin tosses (heads/tails), binary response questions (yes/no), and defect status (defective/non-defective).\nIf a random variable \\(X\\) follows a Bernoulli distribution, it is determined by the parameter \\(p\\), which is the probability of the positive case:\n\\[ X \\sim Bernoulli(p).\\] The probability mass function (PMF) of the Bernoulli distribution is given by: \\[\nP(X = x) =\n\\begin{cases}\np & \\text{if } x = 1 \\\\\n1 - p & \\text{if } x = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(0 \\leq p \\leq 1\\).

The final column reiterates our search expression.\n\nhead(query1)\n\nKeyword-in-context with 6 matches.                                                            \n  [ICE_GB/S1A-006.txt, 785]           So I' d rather | eat |\n [ICE_GB/S1A-009.txt, 1198]              I must &lt;, &gt; | eat |\n  [ICE_GB/S1A-010.txt, 958]         to &lt;, &gt; actually | eat |\n  [ICE_GB/S1A-018.txt, 455] order one first and then | eat |\n  [ICE_GB/S1A-018.txt, 498]  A &gt; The bargain hunting | eat |\n [ICE_GB/S1A-023.txt, 1853]       B &gt; Oh name please | eat |\n                            \n beforehand just to avoid uh\n them &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-009#71:  \n it for one' s              \n it and then sort of        \n &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-018#29: 1     \n something &lt;,, &gt;            \n\n\nFor a full screen display of the KWIC data frame, try View():\n\nView(query1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocname\nfrom\nto\npre\nkeyword\npost\npattern\n\n\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-006.txt\n785\n785\nSo I ' d rather\neat\nbeforehand just to avoid uh\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-009.txt\n1198\n1198\nI must &lt; , &gt;\neat\nthem &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-009 #71 :\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-010.txt\n958\n958\nto &lt; , &gt; actually\neat\nit for one ' s\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-018.txt\n455\n455\norder one first and then\neat\nit and then sort of\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-018.txt\n498\n498\nA &gt; The bargain hunting\neat\n&lt; ICE-GB:S1A-018 #29 : 1\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-023.txt\n1853\n1853\nB &gt; Oh name please\neat\nsomething &lt; , , &gt;\neat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.2 Multi-word queries\nIf the search expression exceeds a single word, we need to mark it as a multi-word sequence by means of the phrase() function. For instance, if we were interested in the pattern eat a, we’d have to adjust the code as follows:\n\nquery2 &lt;- kwic(ICE_GB, phrase(\"eat a\"))\n\n\nView(query2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocname\nfrom\nto\npre\nkeyword\npost\npattern\n\n\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-059.txt\n2230\n2231\n1 : B &gt; I\neat a\n&lt; , &gt; very balanced\neat a\n\n\nICE_GB/W2B-014.txt\n1045\n1046\n: 1 &gt; We can't\neat a\nlot of Welsh or Scottish\neat a\n\n\nICE_GB/W2B-022.txt\n589\n590\nhave few labour-saving devices ,\neat a\ndiet low in protein ,\neat a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.3 Multiple simultaneous queries\nA very powerful advantage of quanteda over traditional corpus software is that we can query a corpus for a multitude of keywords at the same time. Say, we need our output to contain hits for eat, drink as well as sleep. Instead of a single keyword, we supply a character vector containing the strings of interest.\n\nquery3 &lt;- kwic(ICE_GB, c(\"eat\", \"drink\", \"sleep\"))\n\n\nView(query3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocname\nfrom\nto\npre\nkeyword\npost\npattern\n\n\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-006.txt\n785\n785\nSo I ' d rather\neat\nbeforehand just to avoid uh\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-009.txt\n869\n869\n: A &gt; Do you\ndrink\nquite a lot of it\ndrink\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-009.txt\n1198\n1198\nI must &lt; , &gt;\neat\nthem &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-009 #71 :\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-010.txt\n958\n958\nto &lt; , &gt; actually\neat\nit for one ' s\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-014.txt\n3262\n3262\nyou were advised not to\ndrink\nwater in Leningrad because they\ndrink\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-016.txt\n3290\n3290\n&gt; I couldn't I couldn't\nsleep\nif I didn't read &lt;\nsleep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.4 Window size\nSome studies require more detailed examination of the preceding or following context of the keyword.

Their sum corresponds to our 53 observations in total.\n\ntable(query1$keyword)\n\n\neat Eat \n 52   1 \n\n\n\n… how is the keyword distributed across corpus files?\n\nThis question relates to the notion of dispersion: Is a keyword spread relatively evenly across corpus files or does it only occur in specific ones?\n\nquery_distrib &lt;- table(query1$docname, query1$keyword)\n\n# Create a simple dot plot\ndotplot(query_distrib, auto.key = list(columns = 2, title = \"Tokens\", cex.title = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that eat occurs at least once in most text categories (both spoken and written), but seems to be much more common in face-to-face conversations (S1A). This is not surprising: It is certainly more common to discuss food in a casual chat with friends than in an academic essay (unless, of course, its main subject matter is food). Dispersion measures can thus be viewed as indicators of contextual preferences associated with lexemes or more grammatical patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced: More on dispersion\n\n\n\n\n\nThe empirical study of dispersion has attracted a lot of attention in recent years Gries (2020). A reason for this is the necessity of finding a dispersion measure that is minimally correlated with token frequency. One such measure is the Kullback-Leibler divergence \\(KLD\\), which comes from the field of information theory and is closely related to entropy.\nMathematically, \\(KLD\\) measures the difference between two probability distributions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\\[ KLD(p \\parallel q) = \\sum\\limits_{x \\in X} p(x) \\log \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\n\\tag{11.1}\\]\nLet \\(f\\) denote the overall frequency of a keyword in the corpus, \\(v\\) its frequency in each corpus part, \\(s\\) the sizes of each corpus part (as fractions) and \\(n\\) the total number of corpus parts. We thus compare the posterior (= “actual”) distribution of keywords \\(\\frac{v_i}{f}\\) for \\(i = 1, ..., n\\) with their prior distribution, which assumes all words are spread evenly across corpus parts (hence the division by \\(s_i\\)).\n\\[ KLD = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\frac{v_i}{f} \\times \\log_2\\left({\\frac{v_i}{f} \\times \\frac{1}{s_i}}\\right)\n\\tag{11.2}\\]\nIn R, let’s calculate the dispersion of the verbs eat, drink, and sleep from query3.\n\n# Let's filter out the upper-case variants:\nquery3_reduced &lt;- query3[query3$keyword %in% c(\"eat\", \"drink\", \"sleep\"),]\ntable(query3_reduced$keyword)\n\n\ndrink   eat sleep \n   48    52    41 \n\n# Extract text categories\nquery_registers &lt;- separate_wider_delim(query3_reduced, cols = docname, delim = \"-\", names = c(\"Text_category\", \"File_number\"))\n\n# Get separate data frames for each verb\neat &lt;- filter(query_registers, keyword == \"eat\")\ndrink &lt;- filter(query_registers, keyword == \"drink\")\nsleep &lt;- filter(query_registers, keyword == \"sleep\")\n\n## Get frequency distribution across files\nv_eat &lt;- table(eat$Text_category)\nv_drink &lt;- table(drink$Text_category)\nv_sleep &lt;- table(sleep$Text_category)\n\n## Get total frequencies\nf_eat &lt;- nrow(eat)\nf_drink &lt;- nrow(drink)\nf_sleep &lt;- nrow(sleep)\n\n# The next step is a little trickier. First we need to find out how many distinct corpus parts there are in the ICE corpus.\n\n## Check ICE-corpus structure and convert to data frame\nICE_GB_str &lt;- as.data.frame(summary(ICE_GB))\n\n## Separate files from text categores\nICE_GB_texts &lt;- separate_wider_delim(ICE_GB_str, cols = Var1, delim = \"-\", names = c(\"Text_category\", \"File\"))\n\n## Get number of distinct text categories\nn &lt;- length(unique(ICE_GB_texts$Text_category))\n\n## Get proportions of distinct text categories (s)\ns &lt;- table(ICE_GB_texts$Text_category)/sum(table(ICE_GB_texts$Text_category))\n\n## Unfortunately not all of these corpus parts are represented in our queries. We need to correct the proportions in s for the missing ones!\n\n## Store unique ICE text categories \nICE_unique_texts &lt;- unique(ICE_GB_texts$Text_category)\n\n## Make sure only those text proportions are included where the keywords actually occur\ns_eat &lt;- s[match(names(v_eat), ICE_unique_texts)]\ns_drink &lt;- s[match(names(v_drink), ICE_unique_texts)]\ns_sleep &lt;- s[match(names(v_sleep), ICE_unique_texts)]\n\n# Compute KLD for each verb\nkld_eat &lt;- sum(v_eat/f_eat * log2(v_eat/f_eat * 1/s_eat)); kld_eat\n\n[1] 0.6747268\n\nkld_drink &lt;- sum(v_drink/f_drink * log2(v_drink/f_drink * 1/s_drink)); kld_drink\n\n[1] 0.8463608\n\nkld_sleep &lt;- sum(v_sleep/f_sleep * log2(v_sleep/f_sleep * 1/s_sleep)); kld_sleep\n\n[1] 0.7047421\n\n# Plot\nkld_df &lt;- data.frame(kld_eat, kld_drink, kld_sleep)\n\nbarplot(as.numeric(kld_df), names.arg = names(kld_df), col = \"steelblue\",\n        xlab = \"Variable\", ylab = \"KLD Value (= deviance from even distribution)\", main = \"Dispersion of 'eat', 'drink', and 'sleep'\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot indicates that drink is the most unevenly distributed verb out of the three considered (high KDL \\(\\sim\\) low dispersion), whereas eat appears to be slightly more evenly distributed across corpus files. The verb sleep assumes an intermediary position.",

Among the most popular options are AntConc (Anthony 2020) and SketchEngine (Kilgarriff et al. 2004). However, as Schweinberger (2024) notes, the exact processes these tools use to generate output are not always fully transparent, making them something of a “black box.” In contrast, programming languages like R or Python allow researchers to document each step of their analysis clearly, providing full transparency from start to finish.\nThe following apps attempt to reconcile the need for an intuitive user interface with transparent data handling.
