    "text": "Preface\nThis collection of handouts provides a hands-on introduction to data analysis and statistical methods in quantitative corpus linguistics with R. It is designed with accessibility in mind, assuming no prior knowledge of programming or statistics. All you need to get started is a laptop; everything else will be explained within these pages.\nPrimarily, this reader is geared towards students attending the classes Language Variation (BA) and Statistics for Linguistics (MA) at the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt (Germany). However, it is also meant to equip students currently working on their BA/MA/PhD theses with the tools they need to conduct empirical studies on a wide array of linguistic phenomena. The methods presented here reflect the state-of-the-art in corpus-linguistic research, providing readers with current and relevant analytical techniques.",

The second section introduces R as an analytical tool, covering its core functionality. With these fundamentals in place, we proceed to query corpora directly within R. Chapters four and five focus on describing discrete and continuous outputs, as well as identifying meaningful associations and differences in the data (BA). Finally, to gain more nuanced insights into potential patterns, we apply common machine learning algorithms to fit, evaluate, and interpret statistical models (MA).\nThroughout this journey, readers will develop the skills to conduct robust corpus-linguistic analyses, from basic querying to advanced statistical modeling.",

    "text": "17.2 Continuous distributions\n\n17.2.1 The normal distribution\nA great number of numerical variables in the world follow the well-known normal (or Gaussian) distribution, which includes test scores, weight and height, among many others. The plot below illustrates its characteristic bell-shape: Most observations are in the middle, with considerably fewer near the fringes. For example, most people are rather “average” in height; there are only few people that are extremely short or extremely tall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe normal distribution is typically described in terms of two parameters: The population mean \\(\\mu\\) and the population standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\). If a random variable \\(X\\) is normally distributed, we typically use the notation in Equation 17.1.\n\\[ X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2).\n\\tag{17.1}\\]\nThese two parameters affect the shape of the probability density function (PDF) \\(f(x)\\), which is formally defined as\n\\[\nf(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi \\sigma^2}} e^{-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2 \\sigma^2}}.\n\\tag{17.2}\\]\nIn practice, this function returns a bell curve:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick facts about the Gaussian bell curve\n\n\n\nQuite interestingly,\n\n68% all values fall within one standard deviation of the mean,\n95% within two, and\n99.7% within three.\n\n\n\nIn the plot, the \\(y\\)-axis indicates the density of population values; note that since the Gaussian distribution is a continuous distribution with technically infinite \\(x\\)-values, the probability of any given value must be 0. We can only obtain probabilities for intervals of values, which are given by\n\\[\nP(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_a^b f(x)dx.\n\\tag{17.3}\\]\nWe can find the population mean of \\(X\\) with a PDF \\(f(x)\\) via\n\\[\nE(X) = \\mu = \\int_x xf(x)dx,\n\\tag{17.4}\\]\nwhere \\(E(X)\\) denotes the expected value of \\(X\\), i.e., the mean. Essentially, multiplying every value \\(x\\) by its respective probability density \\(f(x)\\) and integrating over all possible values of \\(x\\) will return \\(E(X) = \\mu\\).",

    "text": "17.3 Discrete distributions\n\n17.3.1 Bernoulli distribution\nThe Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution for random variables which have only two possible outcomes: “positive” (often coded as 1) and “negative” (often coded as 0). Examples of such variables include coin tosses (heads/tails), binary response questions (yes/no), and defect status (defective/non-defective).\nIf a random variable \\(X\\) follows a Bernoulli distribution, it is determined by the parameter \\(p\\), which is the probability of the positive case:\n\\[ X \\sim Bernoulli(p).\\] The probability mass function (PMF) of the Bernoulli distribution is given by: \\[\nP(X = x) =\n\\begin{cases}\np & \\text{if } x = 1 \\\\\n1 - p & \\text{if } x = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(0 \\leq p \\leq 1\\). This function shows the probability of \\(X\\) taking on the value of 1 or 0 (cf. Heumann, Schomaker, and Shalabh 2022: 162-163).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.3.2 Binomial Distribution\nThe binomial distribution models the number of successes in \\(n\\) independent Bernoulli trials, each with probability \\(p\\) of success.

If a random variable \\(\\mathbf{X} = (X_1,...,X_k)\\) follows a multinomial distribution, we write:\n\\[ \\mathbf{X} \\sim Multinomial(n,\\mathbf{p}) \\]\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for the multinomial distribution is:\n\\[ P(\\mathbf{X} = \\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{n!}{x_1!x_2!...x_k!} p_1^{x_1}p_2^{x_2}...p_k^{x_k} \\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(n\\) is the number of trials\n\\(\\mathbf{x} = (x_1,...,x_k)\\) represents the number of occurrences of each outcome\n\\(\\mathbf{p} = (p_1,...,p_k)\\) represents the probabilities of each outcome\n\\(\\sum_{i=1}^k x_i = n\\) and \\(\\sum_{i=1}^k p_i = 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nAgresti, Alan, and Maria Kateri. 2022.

We supply the corpus as well as the keyword we’re interested in:\n\nquery1 &lt;- kwic(ICE_GB, \"eat\")\n\nThe output in query1 contains concordance lines that list all occurrences of the keyword, including the document, context to the left, the keyword itself, and the context to the right. The final column reiterates our search expression.\n\nhead(query1)\n\nKeyword-in-context with 6 matches.                                                            \n  [ICE_GB/S1A-006.txt, 785]           So I' d rather | eat |\n [ICE_GB/S1A-009.txt, 1198]              I must &lt;, &gt; | eat |\n  [ICE_GB/S1A-010.txt, 958]         to &lt;, &gt; actually | eat |\n  [ICE_GB/S1A-018.txt, 455] order one first and then | eat |\n  [ICE_GB/S1A-018.txt, 498]  A &gt; The bargain hunting | eat |\n [ICE_GB/S1A-023.txt, 1853]       B &gt; Oh name please | eat |\n                            \n beforehand just to avoid uh\n them &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-009#71:  \n it for one' s              \n it and then sort of        \n &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-018#29: 1     \n something &lt;,, &gt;            \n\n\nFor a full screen display of the KWIC data frame, try View():\n\nView(query1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocname\nfrom\nto\npre\nkeyword\npost\npattern\n\n\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-006.txt\n785\n785\nSo I ' d rather\neat\nbeforehand just to avoid uh\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-009.txt\n1198\n1198\nI must &lt; , &gt;\neat\nthem &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-009 #71 :\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-010.txt\n958\n958\nto &lt; , &gt; actually\neat\nit for one ' s\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-018.txt\n455\n455\norder one first and then\neat\nit and then sort of\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-018.txt\n498\n498\nA &gt; The bargain hunting\neat\n&lt; ICE-GB:S1A-018 #29 : 1\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-023.txt\n1853\n1853\nB &gt; Oh name please\neat\nsomething &lt; , , &gt;\neat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.2 Multi-word queries\nIf the search expression exceeds a single word, we need to mark it as a multi-word sequence by means of the phrase() function. For instance, if we were interested in the pattern eat a, we’d have to adjust the code as follows:\n\nquery2 &lt;- kwic(ICE_GB, phrase(\"eat a\"))\n\n\nView(query2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocname\nfrom\nto\npre\nkeyword\npost\npattern\n\n\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-059.txt\n2230\n2231\n1 : B &gt; I\neat a\n&lt; , &gt; very balanced\neat a\n\n\nICE_GB/W2B-014.txt\n1045\n1046\n: 1 &gt; We can't\neat a\nlot of Welsh or Scottish\neat a\n\n\nICE_GB/W2B-022.txt\n589\n590\nhave few labour-saving devices ,\neat a\ndiet low in protein ,\neat a\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.3 Multiple simultaneous queries\nA very powerful advantage of quanteda over traditional corpus software is that we can query a corpus for a multitude of keywords at the same time. Say, we need our output to contain hits for eat, drink as well as sleep. Instead of a single keyword, we supply a character vector containing the strings of interest.\n\nquery3 &lt;- kwic(ICE_GB, c(\"eat\", \"drink\", \"sleep\"))\n\n\nView(query3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocname\nfrom\nto\npre\nkeyword\npost\npattern\n\n\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-006.txt\n785\n785\nSo I ' d rather\neat\nbeforehand just to avoid uh\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-009.txt\n869\n869\n: A &gt; Do you\ndrink\nquite a lot of it\ndrink\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-009.txt\n1198\n1198\nI must &lt; , &gt;\neat\nthem &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-009 #71 :\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-010.txt\n958\n958\nto &lt; , &gt; actually\neat\nit for one ' s\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-014.txt\n3262\n3262\nyou were advised not to\ndrink\nwater in Leningrad because they\ndrink\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-016.txt\n3290\n3290\n&gt; I couldn't I couldn't\nsleep\nif I didn't read &lt;\nsleep\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.4 Window size\nSome studies require more detailed examination of the preceding or following context of the keyword. We can easily adjust the window size to suit our needs:\n\nquery4 &lt;- kwic(ICE_GB, \"eat\", window = 20) \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocname\nfrom\nto\npre\nkeyword\npost\npattern\n\n\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-006.txt\n785\n785\n#49 : 1 : A &gt; Yeah &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-006 #50 : 1 : A &gt; So I ' d rather\neat\nbeforehand just to avoid uh &lt; , , &gt; any problems there &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-006 #51 : 1 : B &gt;\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-009.txt\n1198\n1198\n&lt; , &gt; in in the summer &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-009 #70 : 1 : A &gt; I must &lt; , &gt;\neat\nthem &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-009 #71 : 1 : A &gt; Yes &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-009 #72 : 1 : B &gt; You ought\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-010.txt\n958\n958\n1 : B &gt; You know I mean it would seem to be squandering it to &lt; , &gt; actually\neat\nit for one ' s own enjoyment &lt; , , &gt; &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-010 #49 : 1 : A &gt; Mm\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-018.txt\n455\n455\ns so &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-018 #27 : 1 : A &gt; What you should do is order one first and then\neat\nit and then sort of carry on from there &lt; laughter &gt; &lt; , &gt; by which time you wouldn't\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-018.txt\n498\n498\nsecond anyway so &lt; laugh &gt; &lt; , &gt; &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-018 #28 : 1 : A &gt; The bargain hunting\neat\n&lt; ICE-GB:S1A-018 #29 : 1 : B &gt; So all right what did I have &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-018 #30 : 1\neat\n\n\nICE_GB/S1A-023.txt\n1853\n1853\n&gt; I can't bear it &lt; , , &gt; &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-023 #121 : 1 : B &gt; Oh name please\neat\nsomething &lt; , , &gt; &lt; ICE-GB:S1A-023 #122 : 1 : A &gt; Oh actually Dad asked me if &lt;\neat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.3.5 Saving your output\nYou can store your results in a spreadsheet file just as described in the unit on importing and exporting data.\n\nMicrosoft Excel (.xlsx)\n\n\nlibrary(writexl) # required for writing files to MS Excel\n\nwrite_xlsx(query2, \"myresults1.xlsx\")\n\n\nLibreOffice (.csv)\n\n\nwrite.csv(query2, \"myresults1.csv\")\n\nAs soon as you have annotated your data, you can load .xlsx files back into R with read_xlsx() from the readxl package and .csv files using the Base R function read.csv().",

Their sum corresponds to our 53 observations in total.\n\ntable(query1$keyword)\n\n\neat Eat \n 52   1 \n\n\n\n… how is the keyword distributed across corpus files?\n\nThis question relates to the notion of dispersion: Is a keyword spread relatively evenly across corpus files or does it only occur in specific ones?\n\nquery_distrib &lt;- table(query1$docname, query1$keyword)\n\n# Create a simple dot plot\ndotplot(query_distrib, auto.key = list(columns = 2, title = \"Tokens\", cex.title = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt seems that eat occurs at least once in most text categories (both spoken and written), but seems to be much more common in face-to-face conversations (S1A). This is not surprising: It is certainly more common to discuss food in a casual chat with friends than in an academic essay (unless, of course, its main subject matter is food). Dispersion measures can thus be viewed as indicators of contextual preferences associated with lexemes or more grammatical patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced: More on dispersion\n\n\n\n\n\nThe empirical study of dispersion has attracted a lot of attention in recent years Gries (2020). A reason for this is the necessity of finding a dispersion measure that is minimally correlated with token frequency. One such measure is the Kullback-Leibler divergence \\(KLD\\), which comes from the field of information theory and is closely related to entropy.\nMathematically, \\(KLD\\) measures the difference between two probability distributions \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).\n\\[ KLD(p \\parallel q) = \\sum\\limits_{x \\in X} p(x) \\log \\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\n\\tag{11.1}\\]\nLet \\(f\\) denote the overall frequency of a keyword in the corpus, \\(v\\) its frequency in each corpus part, \\(s\\) the sizes of each corpus part (as fractions) and \\(n\\) the total number of corpus parts. We thus compare the posterior (= “actual”) distribution of keywords \\(\\frac{v_i}{f}\\) for \\(i = 1, ..., n\\) with their prior distribution, which assumes all words are spread evenly across corpus parts (hence the division by \\(s_i\\)).\n\\[ KLD = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n \\frac{v_i}{f} \\times \\log_2\\left({\\frac{v_i}{f} \\times \\frac{1}{s_i}}\\right)\n\\tag{11.2}\\]\nIn R, let’s calculate the dispersion of the verbs eat, drink, and sleep from query3.\n\n# Let's filter out the upper-case variants:\nquery3_reduced &lt;- query3[query3$keyword %in% c(\"eat\", \"drink\", \"sleep\"),]\ntable(query3_reduced$keyword)\n\n\ndrink   eat sleep \n   48    52    41 \n\n# Extract text categories\nquery_registers &lt;- separate_wider_delim(query3_reduced, cols = docname, delim = \"-\", names = c(\"Text_category\", \"File_number\"))\n\n# Get separate data frames for each verb\neat &lt;- filter(query_registers, keyword == \"eat\")\ndrink &lt;- filter(query_registers, keyword == \"drink\")\nsleep &lt;- filter(query_registers, keyword == \"sleep\")\n\n## Get frequency distribution across files\nv_eat &lt;- table(eat$Text_category)\nv_drink &lt;- table(drink$Text_category)\nv_sleep &lt;- table(sleep$Text_category)\n\n## Get total frequencies\nf_eat &lt;- nrow(eat)\nf_drink &lt;- nrow(drink)\nf_sleep &lt;- nrow(sleep)\n\n# The next step is a little trickier. First we need to find out how many distinct corpus parts there are in the ICE corpus.\n\n## Check ICE-corpus structure and convert to data frame\nICE_GB_str &lt;- as.data.frame(summary(ICE_GB))\n\n## Separate files from text categores\nICE_GB_texts &lt;- separate_wider_delim(ICE_GB_str, cols = Var1, delim = \"-\", names = c(\"Text_category\", \"File\"))\n\n## Get number of distinct text categories\nn &lt;- length(unique(ICE_GB_texts$Text_category))\n\n## Get proportions of distinct text categories (s)\ns &lt;- table(ICE_GB_texts$Text_category)/sum(table(ICE_GB_texts$Text_category))\n\n## Unfortunately not all of these corpus parts are represented in our queries. We need to correct the proportions in s for the missing ones!\n\n## Store unique ICE text categories \nICE_unique_texts &lt;- unique(ICE_GB_texts$Text_category)\n\n## Make sure only those text proportions are included where the keywords actually occur\ns_eat &lt;- s[match(names(v_eat), ICE_unique_texts)]\ns_drink &lt;- s[match(names(v_drink), ICE_unique_texts)]\ns_sleep &lt;- s[match(names(v_sleep), ICE_unique_texts)]\n\n# Compute KLD for each verb\nkld_eat &lt;- sum(v_eat/f_eat * log2(v_eat/f_eat * 1/s_eat)); kld_eat\n\n[1] 0.6747268\n\nkld_drink &lt;- sum(v_drink/f_drink * log2(v_drink/f_drink * 1/s_drink)); kld_drink\n\n[1] 0.8463608\n\nkld_sleep &lt;- sum(v_sleep/f_sleep * log2(v_sleep/f_sleep * 1/s_sleep)); kld_sleep\n\n[1] 0.7047421\n\n# Plot\nkld_df &lt;- data.frame(kld_eat, kld_drink, kld_sleep)\n\nbarplot(as.numeric(kld_df), names.arg = names(kld_df), col = \"steelblue\",\n        xlab = \"Variable\", ylab = \"KLD Value (= deviance from even distribution)\", main = \"Dispersion of 'eat', 'drink', and 'sleep'\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot indicates that drink is the most unevenly distributed verb out of the three considered (high KDL \\(\\sim\\) low dispersion), whereas eat appears to be slightly more evenly distributed across corpus files. The verb sleep assumes an intermediary position.",

However, as Schweinberger (2024) notes, the exact processes these tools use to generate output are not always fully transparent, making them something of a “black box.” In contrast, programming languages like R or Python allow researchers to document each step of their analysis clearly, providing full transparency from start to finish.\nThe following apps attempt to reconcile the need for an intuitive user interface with transparent data handling.

It is better to make a small contribution to a particular problem than to aim at covering a whole subfield of sociolinguistics.\nKeep a research question stable in your paper, even if you come across interesting new ideas as you work on it.\nThe research question must be an explicit part of your paper. Mention it in the introduction and keep referring back to it from time to time.\nKeep in mind that the research question will determine both methodology and data.\n\n\nCf. Hazen (2015): 9–10\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Hypotheses\nResearch questions must be complemented by a set of falsifiable hypotheses. These will be covered in-depth in the chapter on hypothesis testing. In short,\n\nHypothesis \\(H_1\\) predicts a specific relationship between a dependent variable and an independent variable. If \\(H_1\\) holds, studies often speak of a correlation (or association) between variables.\nits opposite, Hypothesis \\(H_0\\), describes the state of affairs where the predicted relationship between the variables does not hold.\n\nThe predictions made by the hypotheses are based on previous research. Here is an example:\nResearch question: I am studying the pronunciation of [r] in New York because I want to find out whether different social groups differ with respect to their pronunciation, in order to help my readers understand how social factors influence our linguistic behavior.\n\nHypothesis \\(H_1\\): There is a difference in the use of postvocalic /r/ between upper-class and lower-class speakers.\nHypothesis \\(H_0\\): There is no difference in the use of postvocalic /r/ between upper-class and lower-class speakers.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Exercises\n\nExercise 2.1 Assess the following research questions!\n\nI will try to find the specific linguistic features which a Shetlander uses when speaking Scottish standard English, i.e., Shetland accent in Scottish Standard English.\nIn this paper, I am going to analyze the use of American and Indian dialect features among Indian immigrants to the US because I want to find out whether they correlate with their willingness to integrate into American society; this will show the degree to which linguistic adaptation depends on cultural orientation.\nIn this paper, I am going to address the question of how gender influences language.\nThe study aims to contribute to the investigation of the controversial question of the effect of speaker’s age and sex on quotative use in American English, focusing on the newer quotatives be like, go, be all.\nIn this paper, adverts by Coca-Cola and Pepsi will be analyzed for the use of verb forms.\n\n\n\nExercise 2.2 Develop valid research questions on the basis of the following linguistic variables:\n\nSpeakers in bilingual conversations are especially likely to code-switch when there is a significant change of topic.\nWomen use more tentative language in conversations than men.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooth, Wayne C., Gregory G.

    "section": "18.2 Hypothesis testing",
    "text": "18.2 Hypothesis testing\nThe null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) framework offers researchers a convenient way of testing theoretical assumptions about a population of interest (e.g., a speech community). This involves setting up a set of falsifiable statistical hypotheses that predict the presence or absence of certain patterns in the data. These are known as the null hypothesis \\(H_0\\) and the alternative hypothesis \\(H_1\\) (or \\(H_a\\)). They are set up before seeing the data and justified by previous research.\n\nGiven two categorical variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), we assume under \\(H_0\\) that both variables are independent from each other. This hypothesis describes the “default state of the world” (James et al. 2021: 555), i.e., what we would usually expect to see. There is no association between the variables of interest and, therefore, no effect.\nBy contrast, the alternative hypothesis \\(H_1\\) claims that \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are not independent, i.e., that \\(H_0\\) does not hold. \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) then appear to be correlated in some way, i.e., there is some kind of effect.\n\nIn the subsequent sections, we will consider two scenarios:\n\nWe are interested in finding out whether English clause ORDER (‘sc-mc’ or ‘mc-sc’) depends on the type of the subordinate clause (SUBORDTYPE), which can be either temporal (‘temp’) or causal (‘caus’).\n\nOur hypotheses are:\n\n\\(H_0:\\) The variables ORDER and SUBORDTYPE are independent.\n\\(H_1:\\) The variables ORDER and SUBORDTYPE are not independent.\n\n\nAs part of a phonetic study, we compare the base frequencies of the F1 formants for male and female speakers of Apache. We forward the following hypotheses:\n\n\n\\(H_0:\\) mean F1 frequency of men \\(=\\) mean F1 frequency of women.\n\\(H_1:\\) mean F1 frequency of men \\(\\ne\\) mean F1 frequency of women.\n\nBased on our data, we can decide to either accept or reject \\(H_0\\). Rejecting \\(H_0\\) can be viewed as evidence in favour of \\(H_1\\) and thus marks a potential ‘discovery’ in the data. However, there is always a chance that we accept or reject the wrong hypothesis; the four possible constellations are summarised in the table below (cf. Heumann, Schomaker, and Shalabh 2022: 223):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_0\\) is true\n\\(H_0\\) is not true\n\n\n\n\n\\(H_0\\) is not rejected\n\\(\\color{green}{\\text{Correct decision}}\\)\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Type II } (\\beta)\\text{-error}}\\)\n\n\n\\(H_0\\) is rejected\n\\(\\color{red}{\\text{Type I } (\\alpha)\\text{-error}}\\)\n\\(\\color{green}{\\text{Correct decision}}\\)\n\n\n\nThe probability of a Type I error, which refers to the rejection of \\(H_0\\) although it is true, is called the significance level \\(\\alpha\\), which has a conventional value of \\(0.05\\) (i.e., a 5% chance of committing a Type I error). Nevertheless, it is always recommended to state explicitly the \\(\\alpha\\)-level used for rejecting/accepting \\(H_0\\).",

    "text": "18.3 Constructing the critical region\nAn important question remains: How great should the difference be for us to reject \\(H_0\\)? The \\(p\\)-value measures the probability of encountering a specific value of a test statistic (\\(\\chi^2\\)-score, \\(t\\), \\(F\\) etc.) on the condition that \\(H_0\\) is true.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more precise definition of \\(p\\)-values\n\n\n\n“The \\(P\\)-value is the probability, presuming that \\(H_0\\) is true, that the test statistic equals the observed value or a value even more extreme in the direction predicted by \\(H_a\\) (Agresti and Kateri 2022: 163)”.\n\n\nFor example, a \\(p\\)-value of \\(0.02\\) means that we would see a particular test statistic only 2% of the time if \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) were unrelated (or if there was no difference between \\(\\bar{x}\\) and \\(\\bar{y}\\), respectively). Since our significance level \\(\\alpha\\) is set to \\(0.05\\), we only reject the null hypothesis if this conditional probability is lower than 5%.\nWe obtain \\(p\\)-values by consulting the probability density functions of the underlying sampling distributions:\n\nProbability density function for the \\(\\chi^2\\)-distribution with \\(df = 1\\)\n\n\n\nCode\n# Generate random samples from a chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom\nx &lt;- rchisq(100000, df = 1)\n\n# Create histogram\nhist(x,\n     breaks = \"Scott\",\n     freq = FALSE,\n     xlim = c(0, 20),\n     ylim = c(0, 0.2),\n     ylab = \"Probability density of observing a specific score\",\n     xlab = \"Chi-squared score\",\n     main = \"Histogram for a chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom (df)\",\n     cex.main = 0.9)\n\n# Overlay PDF\ncurve(dchisq(x, df = 1), from = 0, to = 150, n = 5000, col = \"orange\", lwd = 2, add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbability density function for the \\(t\\)-distribution with \\(df = 112.19\\)\n\n\n\nCode\n# Given t-statistic and degrees of freedom\nt_statistic &lt;- 2.4416\ndf &lt;- 112.19\n\n# Generate random samples from a t-distribution with the given degrees of freedom\nx &lt;- rt(100000, df = df)\n\n# Create histogram\nhist(x,\n     breaks = \"Scott\",\n     freq = FALSE,\n     xlim = c(-5, 5),\n     ylim = c(0, 0.4),\n     ylab = \"Probability density of observing a specific score\",\n     xlab = \"t-score\",\n     main = \"Histogram for a t-distribution with 112.19 degrees of freedom\",\n     cex.main = 0.9)\n\n# Overlay PDF\ncurve(dt(x, df = df), from = -5, to = 5, n = 5000, col = \"orange\", lwd = 2, add = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgresti, Alan, and Maria Kateri. 2022.

    "text": "26.3 Descriptive overview\nA popular descriptive measure for associations between continuous variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (or simply Pearson’s \\(r\\); cf. Equation 26.1). It varies on a scale from \\(-1\\) to \\(1\\) and indicates the extent to which two variables form a straight-line relationship (Heumann, Schomaker, and Shalabh 2022: 153-154). One of its core components is the covariance between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) which “measures the average tendency of two variables to covary (change together)” (Baguley 2012: 206).\n\\[\nr_{xy} = \\frac{Cov(x, y)}{\\sqrt{Var(x)}\\sqrt{Var(y)}}= \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}}.\n\\tag{26.1}\\]\nIn R, we can compute Pearson’s \\(r\\) by using the cor() function.\n\n# Check correlation between number of senses and concreteness\ncor(scope_sem_sub[,-1]$Nsenses_WordNet, scope_sem_sub[,-1]$Conc_Brys) # low\n\n[1] 0.2351554\n\n# Check correlation between haptic experience and concreteness\ncor(scope_sem_sub[,-1]$Haptic_Lanc, scope_sem_sub[,-1]$Conc_Brys) # high\n\n[1] 0.5676945\n\n\nIf the data frame consists of numeric columns only (i.e., if it is a matrix), we can apply cor() to the full dataset and obtain the correlation matrix (also known as covariance matrix).\n\n# Generate correlation matrix\ncor_mat1 &lt;- cor(scope_sem_sub[,-1])\n\nhead(cor_mat1)\n\n                   Resnik_strength  Conc_Brys Nsenses_WordNet\nResnik_strength         1.00000000  0.1166670     -0.37442983\nConc_Brys               0.11666697  1.0000000      0.23515537\nNsenses_WordNet        -0.37442983  0.2351554      1.00000000\nNmeanings_Websters     -0.34225250  0.2023356      0.68509560\nVisual_Lanc             0.05471417  0.5519836      0.17154846\nAuditory_Lanc          -0.11162700 -0.2683646     -0.02960745\n                   Nmeanings_Websters Visual_Lanc Auditory_Lanc  Haptic_Lanc\nResnik_strength            -0.3422525  0.05471417   -0.11162700  0.008260683\nConc_Brys                   0.2023356  0.55198358   -0.26836458  0.567694470\nNsenses_WordNet             0.6850956  0.17154846   -0.02960745  0.239470104\nNmeanings_Websters          1.0000000  0.14597243   -0.04656650  0.193226862\nVisual_Lanc                 0.1459724  1.00000000   -0.11674896  0.404536416\nAuditory_Lanc              -0.0465665 -0.11674896    1.00000000 -0.289586292\n                   Olfactory_Lanc Gustatory_Lanc Interoceptive_Lanc\nResnik_strength        0.05131717    0.015087346      -9.459551e-02\nConc_Brys              0.21354305    0.123459754      -3.257702e-01\nNsenses_WordNet       -0.03353627   -0.018262178      -1.392934e-02\nNmeanings_Websters    -0.01898766    0.001409646      -4.460375e-05\nVisual_Lanc            0.15319007    0.055176064      -3.424087e-01\nAuditory_Lanc         -0.06123191   -0.047086877       1.799479e-01\n\n# Plot correlation matrix\ncorrplot(cor_mat1, col = topo.colors(200), tl.col = \"darkgrey\", number.cex = 0.5, tl.cex = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the upper triangle mirrors the lower one, it is enough to only examine one of them.

This is also known as dimension reduction, which allows researchers to see overarching patterns in the data and re-use the output for further analysis (e.g., clustering or predictive modelling).",

    "text": "26.4 Basics of PCA\nPCA “repackages” large sets of variables by forming uncorrelated linear combinations of them, yielding \\(k\\) principal components \\(Z_1, ..., Z_k\\) (PCs hf.) of the dataset (for \\(1, ..., k\\)). PCs are ordered such that the first PC explains the most variance in the data, with each subsequent PC explaining the maximum remaining variance while being uncorrelated with previous PCs.\nEach PC comprises a set of loadings (or weights) \\(w_{nm}\\), which are comparable to the coefficients of regression equations. For instance, the first PC has the general form shown in Equation 26.2, where \\(x_m\\) stand for continuous input variables in the \\(n \\times m\\) data matrix \\(\\mathbf{X}\\).\n\\[\nZ_{1} = w_{11}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_{11} \\\\\nx_{21} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_{n1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n+ w_{21}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_{12} \\\\\nx_{22} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_{n2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n+ \\dots + w_{m1}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nx_{1m} \\\\\nx_{2m} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_{nm}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\tag{26.2}\\]\nIf a feature positively loads on a principal component (i.e., \\(w &gt; 0\\)), it means that as the value of this feature increases, the score for this principal component also increases. The magnitude of \\(w\\) indicates the strength of this relationship. Conversely, negative loadings (\\(w &lt; 0\\)) indicate that as the feature value increases, the PC score decreases as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do we find PCs?\n\n\n\n\n\nPCs are identified using common techniques from matrix algebra, namely singular value decomposition and eigenvalue decomposition. By breaking down the input data into products of several further matrices, it becomes possible to characterise the exact ‘shape’ of its variance (Mair 2018: 181).\n\n\n\nThe figure below offers a visual summary of PCA:",

PC2 scores decrease if a verb has fewer meanings, but they increase if it displays higher selectional preference strength.\nInternal sensation: PC3 captures variance in olfactory, gustatory and interoceptive2 ratings.\n\n2 Here interoceptive means “[t]o what extent one experiences the referent by sensations inside one’s body” (Gao, Shinkareva, and Desai 2022: 2859).\n\n\n\n\n\nBaguley, Thomas. 2012.

    "section": "22.3 Logistic regression",
    "text": "22.3 Logistic regression\nIn contrast to linear regression, logistic regression models a qualitative response variable \\(Y\\) with two outcomes2. In the present study, \\(Y\\) is pronominal Reference and has the outcomes Reference = null and Reference = overt, which represent null and overt subjects, respectively. Dichotomous variables of this kind are also often coded as yes/no or 1/0.\n2 Logistic regression can also be used for \\(\\geq 3\\) classes by breaking down the response variable into a series of dichotomous variables. This is also known as multinomial logistic regression or softmax regression.Another difference from linear regression is the output of the model. In linear regression, we obtain a predicted value for the continuous response variable we’re interested in. For instance, if we’re modelling reaction times, the model will return an estimated reaction time (given the predictors).\nIn logistic regression, however, we either get a class label or a probability. When modelling pronominal reference, the model will thus either tell us\n\nwhether a speaker would use an overt or a null subject in a given observation (class prediction).\nwhat the probability of using one variant vs. the other would be (probability prediction).\n\nA core component of logistic regression is the logistic function. The rationale for using it is that the output of the function will always lie between \\(0\\) and \\(1\\), and it will always denote a probability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.3.1 The simple logistic model\nAssuming a binary response variable \\(Y\\) with the values 1 and 0 and a single predictor \\(X\\), we can model the probability \\(P(Y = 1 \\mid X)\\) as\n\\[\nP(Y = 1 \\mid  X) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X}}.\n\\]\nThe above expression is equivalent to\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{P(Y = 1 \\mid  X)}{1 - P(Y = 1 \\mid  X)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X.\n\\]\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{P(Y = 1 \\mid X)}{1-P(Y = 1 \\mid X)}\\) represents the odds, which stand for to the probability of one outcome (e.g., Reference = null) compared to the other (e.g., Reference = overt).\nTheir logarithmic transformation are the log odds (or logits) of one outcome versus the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding log odds\n\n\n\nWhen interpreting the output of a logistic model, note that\n\npositive log odds indicate an increase in \\(\\frac{P(Y = 1 \\mid X)}{1-P(Y = 1 \\mid X)}\\), whereas\nnegative log odds indicate a decrease in \\(\\frac{P(Y = 1 \\mid X)}{1-P(Y = 1 \\mid X)}\\).\n\n\n\nIn more concrete terms: If \\(X = \\text{Register}\\), then our model would have the form:\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{P(\\text{Reference} = \\text{null} \\mid \\text{Register})}{1- P(\\text{Reference} = \\text{null} \\mid \\text{Register})}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Register}\n\\]\nGiven Register, the log odds of a null subject versus an overt one is essentially equivalent to the linear model equation. The model parameters \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) are typically estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation3 (MLE).\n3 The goal of the fitting procedure is to maximise the likelihood function of the parameter matrix \\(\\ell(\\mathbf{\\beta})\\). Via partial differentiation, an intermediary result can be attained which can only be solved using an iterative algorithm (e.g. Newton-Ralphson). For further technical details, see Wood (2006: 63-66) or Agresti & Kateri (2022: 291-294).\n\n22.3.2 Multiple logistic regression\nIf more than one predictor is included, the above equations can be expanded so as to take into account \\(1, ..., p\\) slopes and \\(1, ..., p\\) independent variables \\(X_p\\).\n\\[ P(Y = 1 \\mid X_1, ..., X_p) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + ... + \\beta_pX_p}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + ... + \\beta_pX_p}}.\n\\]\nThus, the log odds correspond to the sum of \\(\\beta_pX_p\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log\\left(\\frac{P(Y = 1 \\mid X_1, ..., X_p)}{1 - P(Y = 1 \\mid X_1, ...,  X_p)}\\right) & = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + ... +  \\beta_pX_p \\\\\n& = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{p} \\beta_i X_i\n\\end{aligned}\n\\] respectively.\n\n\n22.3.3 Odds ratios\nTo assess the strength of an effect, it is instructive to examine the odds ratios that correspond to the model coefficients. Odds ratios (OR) are defined as\n\\[\nOR(X_1) = e^{\\beta_1}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding odds ratios\n\n\n\n\n\nEssentially, the OR describes the ratio between two odds with respect to another independent variable. This is illustrated for Reference given Register below:\n\\[\n\\text{OR}(\\text{Reference} \\mid \\text{Register}) = \\frac{\\frac{P(\\text{Reference} = \\text{null} \\mid \\text{Register} = \\text{S1A})}{P(\\text{Reference} = \\text{overt} \\mid \\text{Register} = \\text{S1A})}}{\\frac{P(\\text{Reference} = \\text{null} \\mid \\text{Register} = \\text{S1B})}{P(\\text{Reference} = \\text{overt} \\mid \\text{Register} = \\text{S1B})}}\n\\]\nRead as: ‘The ratio between the probability of a null vs. overt object in S1A and the probability of a null vs. overt object in S1B’.",

This step is very important because it will directly impact the parameter estimation and, consequently, influence our interpretation of the model output.\n\nThe reference level of the response is usually chosen such that it corresponds to the unmarked or most frequent case. Since overt pronouns are much more common in the data, the reference level of the Reference variable will be set to Reference = overt. This way, the model coefficients will directly represent the probability of the null subject variant (i.e., the special case) given certain predictor configurations.\nThe predictor levels need to be specified as well. Among other things, we are interested in how the Asian Englishes pattern relative to British English. Therefore, we will define British English as the baseline for comparison.\n\nWe will use the following specifications:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nFactor Levels\nPreferred Reference level\n\n\n\n\nRegister\nS1A, S1B\nS1A\n\n\nVariety\nGB, SING, HK\nGB\n\n\nPerson\n1, 2, 3, it, there\n3\n\n\nReferentiality\nreferential, non-referential\nreferential\n\n\n\n\n# Store \"Reference\" as factor\ndata_pro$Reference &lt;- as.factor(data_pro$Reference)\n\n## Specify reference level (the 'unmarked' case)\ndata_pro$Reference &lt;- relevel(data_pro$Reference, \"overt\")\n\n## Print levels\nlevels(data_pro$Reference)\n\n[1] \"overt\" \"null\" \n\n\nRepeat the procedure for the remaining categorical variables.\n\n\nCode\n# Store \"Register\" as factor\ndata_pro$Register &lt;- as.factor(data_pro$Register)\n\n## Specify reference level\ndata_pro$Register &lt;- relevel(data_pro$Register, \"S1A\")\n\n# Store \"Variety\" as factor\ndata_pro$Variety &lt;- as.factor(data_pro$Variety)\n\n## Specify reference level\ndata_pro$Variety &lt;- relevel(data_pro$Variety, \"GB\")\n\n# Store \"Person\" as factor\ndata_pro$Person &lt;- as.factor(data_pro$Person)\n\n## Specify reference level\ndata_pro$Person &lt;- relevel(data_pro$Person, \"3\")\n\n# Store \"Referentiality\" as factor\ndata_pro$Referentiality &lt;- as.factor(data_pro$Referentiality)\n\n## Specify reference level\ndata_pro$Referentiality &lt;- relevel(data_pro$Referentiality, \"referential\")\n\n\n\n\n22.4.3 Step 3: Fit the model\nThere are two functions that can fit logistic models in R: lrm() and glm().\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe model formula below does not include Referentiality because several intermediary steps revealed it to be almost completely irrelevant for predicting Reference.

    "section": "21.4 Linear regression",
    "text": "21.4 Linear regression\n\nLinear regression is a simple approach to supervised machine learning where the response variable is known.1\nIt assumes that the dependence of \\(Y\\) on \\(X\\) is linear, i.e., their relationship is a straight line.\nThis approach is suitable for numerical response variables. The predictors, however, can be either continuous or discrete.\n\n1 If the response variable is unknown or irrelevant, we speak of unsupervised machine learning. Unsupervised models are mostly concerned with finding patterns in high-dimensional datasets with dozens or even hundreds of variables.Although it may seem overly simplistic, linear regression is extremely useful both conceptually and practically.\n\n21.4.1 Model with a single predictor \\(X\\)\nThe simple linear model has the general form\n\\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X + \\epsilon.\n\\tag{21.2}\\]\n\nThe model parameters (or coefficients) \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\) specify the functional relationship \\(f\\) between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\).\nThe first parameter \\(\\beta_0\\) determines the intercept of the regression line, and \\(\\beta_1\\) indicates the slope.\nOnce again, \\(\\epsilon\\) captures the model error, which is equivalent to the sum of all distances of the data points from the regression line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying the model formula to our dataset, we get the following updated regression equation:\n\\[ \\text{Reaction time} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1\\text{Frequency} + \\text{Model Error}. \\]\nBut how do we find the exact values of the intercept and the slope? In short: We can’t! We are dealing with population parameters and can, therefore, only provide an approximation of the true relationship between RT and Freq.\nTo reflect the tentative nature of the model coefficients, we use the hat symbol ^ (e.g., \\(\\hat{\\beta_0}\\)) to indicate estimations rather than true values. The estimation procedure requires training data, based on which the algorithm “learns” the relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\) (hence the term “Machine Learning”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow exactly do you estimate the model parameters?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most common way of estimating parameters for linear models is the Least Squares approach. In essence, the parameters are chosen such that the residual sum of squares, i.e., the sum of the differences between observed and predicted values, is as low as possible. In other words, we are trying to minimise the distances between the data points and the regression line.\nIt can be computed using the equivalence in Equation 21.3.\n\\[ \\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i- \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i- \\bar{x})^2}.\n\\tag{21.3}\\]\nWe can then obtain the intercept via Equation 21.4.\n\\[\n\\hat{\\beta_0}= \\bar{y}- \\hat{\\beta}_1\\bar{x}\n\\tag{21.4}\\]\n\n\n\nOnce we’ve fitted the model, we can then predict reaction times if we know the frequency of a lexical stimulus:\n\\[\n\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1x,\n\\tag{21.5}\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{y}\\) indicates a prediction of \\(Y\\) on the basis of the predictor values \\(X = x\\).\n\n\n21.4.2 Application in R\nIn R, we can fit a linear model with the lm() function.\n\n# Fit linear model\nrt.lm1 = lm(log(RT) ~ log(Freq), data = ELP)\n\n# View model data\nsummary(rt.lm1)\n\n\ntab_model(rt.lm1, show.se = TRUE, show.aic = TRUE, show.dev = TRUE, show.fstat = TRUE, digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\n \nlog(RT)\n\n\nPredictors\nEstimates\nstd.

Since \\(p &lt; 0.001\\), we can reject \\(H_0\\).\nThe \\(p\\)-value itself crucially depends on the \\(t\\)-statistic2, which measures “the number of standard deviations that \\(\\hat{\\beta_1}\\) is away from 0” (James et al. 2021: 67). The standard error (SE) reflects how much an estimated coefficient differs on average from the true values of \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\).

Generally speaking, values greater than 1 indicate a possible correlation. A sufficiently low \\(p\\)-value suggests that the null hypothesis \\(H_0: \\beta_1 = 0\\) can be rejected. The \\(F\\) statistic is computed as shown below (cf.

    "text": "21.6 Model assumptions and diagnostics\nAs a parametric method, linear regression makes numerous assumptions about the training data. It is, therefore, essential to run further tests to rule out possible violations. Among other things, the model assumptions include:\n\nA linear relationship between the response and the quantitative predictors: The residuals should not display a clear pattern. For this reason, it is recommended to use component residual plots (e.g., crPlot() from the car library) for the visual identification of potentially non-linear trends.\n\n\n\nCode\n# pink line = main tendency vs. blue line = slope coefficients;\n# some minor non-linearity can be observed\n\ncrPlot(rt.lm2, var = \"log(Freq)\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncrPlot(rt.lm2, var = \"POS\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncrPlot(rt.lm2, var = \"Length\") # potentially problematic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo heteroscedasticity (i.e, non-constant variance of error terms): Visually, a violation of this assumption becomes apparent if the residuals form a funnel-like shape. It is also possible to conduct a non-constant variance test ncvTest(): If it returns \\(p\\)-values &lt; 0.05, it suggests non-constant variance.\n\n\n\nCode\nplot(rt.lm2, which = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nncvTest(rt.lm2) # significant, meaning that errors do not vary constantly\n\n\nNon-constant Variance Score Test \nVariance formula: ~ fitted.values \nChisquare = 30.0101, Df = 1, p = 4.298e-08\n\n\n\nNo multicollinearity: Predictors should not be correlated with each other. In the model data, correlated variables have unusually high standard errors, thereby decreasing the explanatory power of both the coefficients and the model as a whole. Another diagnostic measure are variance inflation factors (VIF-scores); predictors with VIF scores &gt; 5 are potentially collinear. They can be computed using the vif() function.\n\n\n\nCode\nvif(rt.lm2) # vif &lt; 5 indicates that predictors are not correlated\n\n\n              GVIF Df GVIF^(1/(2*Df))\nlog(Freq) 1.150140  1        1.072446\nPOS       1.026925  2        1.006664\nLength    1.151054  1        1.072872\n\n\n\nNormally distributed residuals: The residuals should follow the normal distribution and be centered around 0:\n\n\\[\n\\epsilon \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\n\\tag{21.12}\\]\nUsually, a visual inspection using qqnorm() is sufficient, but the Shapiro-Wilke test shapiro.test() can also be run on the model residuals.

    "text": "23.3 Multilevel models\nAt their core, mixed-effects models “are extensions of regression in which data are structured in groups and coefficients can vary by group” (Gelman and Hill 2007: 237). Typical grouping structures found in linguistic data include speakers, regions, or lexical stimuli for which multiple observations are attested. Normally, such structures would violate the assumption of independence, but can be controlled for by capturing group-wise tendencies.\nFor illustration, a simple example of a hierarchical dataset is presented in Figure 23.1. If one were to, for instance, measure test scores for every student, it may be of interest how their performance varies not only from student to student but also from school to school. After all, the students are nested within their schools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngraph LR\n    A1[School 1] --&gt; B11(Student 1)\n    A1[School 1] --&gt; B12(Student 2)\n    A1[School 1] --&gt; B13(Student 3)\n    \n    A2[School 2] --&gt; B21(Student 4)\n    A2[School 2] --&gt; B22(Student 5)\n    A2[School 2] --&gt; B23(Student 6)\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 23.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\n\n\n\nRead the following (partial) description of the experiments conducted by Ciaccio & Veríssimo on the morphological processing of complex lexical items (2022):\n\nSixty-nine intermediate to advanced non-native speakers of English (54 women; 15 men) took part in the experiment in exchange for payment or course credits. […] The experiment included 102 English monomorphemic verbs used as targets (e.g., print). These were preceded by their -ed past-tense form (e.g., printed) as the inflected prime, their -er nominalization (e.g., printer) as the derived prime, or by an unrelated prime. Unrelated primes were dissimilar in form and meaning from their corresponding targets; half of them were -ed inflected forms and half of them were -er derived words.

These varying coefficients also known as random effects (cf. Gelman and Hill (2007): 245). In the model equation, the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) and/or the slope \\(\\beta\\) is additionally indexed for the grouping factor. Let \\(J\\) denote the number of groups for \\(j = 1, ..., J\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarying-intercept model\n\n\n\nWe allow group-wise variation in the intercept by replacing \\(\\alpha\\) with \\(\\alpha_{j}\\) to indicate the intercept for the \\(j\\)-th group. It is defined as a random variable and follows the normal distribution. For instance, each participant in the aforementioned psycholinguistic would receive its own intercept rather than a global one for all participants.\n\\[\nY = \\alpha_{j} + \\beta_1X_{1} + \\beta_2X_{2} + ... + \\epsilon \\qquad \\alpha_{j} \\sim N(\\mu_{\\alpha}, \\sigma_{\\alpha}^2)\n\\tag{23.1}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVarying-slope model\n\n\n\nWe will allow group-wise variation in the slope coefficients by replacing them with \\(\\beta_{ij}\\) to indicate the slope for the \\(j\\)-th group. The slope now functions as a random variable and is normally distributed. In the psycholinguistic study, each participant would be assigned its own slope coefficient.\n\\[\nY = \\alpha + \\beta_{1j}X_{1} + \\beta_{2j}X_{2} + ... + \\epsilon \\qquad \\beta_{j} \\sim N(\\mu_{\\beta}, \\sigma_{\\beta}^2)\n\\tag{23.2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n23.3.2 Example\nAssume we are predicting test performance by School.

    "section": "24.4 Modelling ordinal data",
    "text": "24.4 Modelling ordinal data\nOur task is clear: We need to measure how routine and freq affect the variability in the acceptability ratings, while controlling for repeated measurements for verb and ParticipantID, which impose a hierarchical structure on the dataset.\nFormally speaking, we have \\(p\\) explanatory variables \\(X_1, X_2, ..., X_p\\) for \\(1, ..., p\\). The target variable, i.e. our \\(Y\\), is rating with the ordered, discrete outcomes \\(y \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}\\).\nThe goal is to find a model \\(f\\) that describes the relationship between \\(Y\\) and \\(X_p\\) as accurately as possible and minimises the error term \\(\\epsilon\\):\n\\[\nY = f(X_1, X_2, ..., X_p) + \\epsilon\n\\tag{24.1}\\]\n\n24.4.1 Ordered logistic regression\nOne family of models that respects the ordered, yet categorical nature of \\(Y\\) is ordered (or ordinal) logistic regression. Other terms include proportional odds models and cumulative logit/link models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecap: Logistic regression\n\n\n\n\n\nLogistic regression is used to model categorical response variables with two or more levels. For instance, let’s assume our \\(Y\\) is dichotomous with the following two outcomes:\n\\[\nY =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{yes} \\\\\n\\text{no}\n\\end{cases}\n\\tag{24.2}\\]\nUsing the logistic function, we can estimate the probability of one outcome versus the other given the predictors \\(X_p\\). Their log-transformed odds ratio (log odds) is equivalent of the all-too-familiar linear model:\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{P(Y = yes \\mid X_1, X_2, ..., X_p)}{1 - P(Y = yes \\mid X_1, X_2, ..., X_p)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^p \\beta_iX_i\n\\tag{24.3}\\]\n\n\n\nCore to this approach is the notion of cumulative probabilities. Let \\(J\\) denote the number of ordered categories in \\(Y\\). In Glass’s case study, the estimated cumulative probabilities for each ordered outcome (= acceptability rating) would have the forms in Equation 24.4.\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nP(Y \\leq 1) & = & P(Y = 1) \\\\\nP(Y \\leq 2) & = & P(Y = 1) + P(Y = 2) \\\\\nP(Y \\leq 3) & = & P(Y = 1) + P(Y = 2) + P(Y = 3) \\\\\n& \\vdots & \\\\\nP(Y \\leq j) & = & P_1 + ... + P_j\n\\end{array}\n\\tag{24.4}\\]\nWe can now update our logistic regression model to take into account cumulative probabilities for \\(j = 1, ..., J-1\\).\n\\[\n\\log\\left(\\frac{P(Y \\leq j \\mid X_1, X_2, ..., X_p)}{1 - P(Y \\leq j \\mid X_1, X_2, ..., X_p)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^p \\beta_iX_i\n\\tag{24.5}\\]\nThe intercepts \\(\\beta_{0_j}\\) serve as cutpoints between the adjacent ordinal categories. For \\(J = 5\\) categories, there are \\(J - 1 = 4\\) cutpoints, i.e.,\n\n1|2 for \\(P(Y \\leq 1)\\)\n2|3 for \\(P(Y \\leq 2)\\)\n3|4 for \\(P(Y \\leq 3)\\)\n4|5 for \\(P(Y \\leq 4)\\).\n\nGiven a change in predictor values, the slope coefficients \\(\\beta_pX_p\\) indicate how the probability of being in a higher rating category changes (Baguley 2012: 691–2).\nWe can obtain “regular” probabilities from the cumulative ones by drawing on the equivalence in Equation 24.6.\n\\[\nP(Y = j) = P(Y \\leq j) - P(Y \\leq j - 1)\n\\tag{24.6}\\]\nFor instance, the probability \\(P(Y = 3)\\) is equivalent to\n\\[\nP(Y = 3) = P(Y \\leq 3) - P(Y \\leq 2).\n\\tag{24.7}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssumptions of proportional odds models\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proportional odds assumption stipulates a stable effect of the predictors on the (log) odds of the ordinal outcomes across all possible cutpoints (O’Connell 2006: 29). In case of violation, it is better to rely on partial proportional odds models or multinomial logistic regression instead.",

If, however, one is interested in exploring potential non-linear trends without the risk of extreme overfitting, GAMs offer an elegant solution: Instead of relying on the linear sum of model coefficients, GAMs estimate more flexible smooth terms \\(f_k\\) for \\(k = 1, ..., p\\). For illustration, Equation 24.8 shows a linear additive model for a continuous target variable with \\(p\\) predictors.\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^p f_k(X_k)\n\\tag{24.8}\\]\n\n\n24.6.3 Application in R\n\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(mgcv)\nlibrary(itsadug)\nlibrary(gratia)\n\n# Convert predictors to factors\nsurvey$ParticipantID &lt;- as.factor(survey$ParticipantID)\nsurvey$verb &lt;- as.factor(survey$verb)\n\n# Fit GAMM\ngam1 &lt;- bam(as.numeric(rating) ~ # treated as numeric term\n              freq + # linear term\n              routine + # linear term\n              s(ParticipantID, bs = \"re\") + # smooth term\n              s(verb, bs = \"re\"), # smooth term\n              data = survey, \n              family = ocat(R = 5) # number of ordinal categories\n            )\n\n# Model summary\nsummary(gam1)\n\n\nFamily: Ordered Categorical(-1,0.51,2.09,4.06) \nLink function: identity \n\nFormula:\nas.numeric(rating) ~ freq + routine + s(ParticipantID, bs = \"re\") + \n    s(verb, bs = \"re\")\n\nParametric coefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

    "text": "25.3 Decision trees\nCore concepts:\n\nSegmenting the feature space: “[T]he feature space (i.e., the space spanned by all predictor variables) is recursively partitioned into a set of rectangular areas” (Strobl, Malley, and Tutz 2009: 325).\nImpurity reduction: These simplified prediction areas should consist of mostly homogeneous (i.e., ‘pure’ rather than ‘mixed’) observations.\nTree construction: The ‘decisions’ made when partitioning the training data can be visualised using tree structures. The nodes of a tree represent variables, the branches represent decision rules, and leaf nodes indicate the final outcome (e.g., a prediction).\nCART: The original computational implementation of decision trees is known as the CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm developed by Breiman (1984).\n\n\n25.3.1 Classification trees\nIf we are dealing with a categorical response variable, the tree() function can be used to fit a classification tree in accordance with Breiman’s CART algorithm. For illustration, consider the tv data frame. We will model the choice of the pronoun Form based on the speaker’s and hearer’s social circle (Rel_Circle) and their difference in social class (Rel_Class).\n\n# Set random number generator for reproducibility\nset.seed(123)\n\n# Supply model formula\ntree.tv &lt;- tree(Form ~ Rel_Circle + Rel_Class, data = tv)\n\n# View tree statistics\nsummary(tree.tv)\n\n\nClassification tree:\ntree(formula = Form ~ Rel_Circle + Rel_Class, data = tv)\nNumber of terminal nodes:  9 \nResidual mean deviance:  0.974 = 213.3 / 219 \nMisclassification error rate: 0.2412 = 55 / 228 \n\n# Visualisation\nplot(tree.tv)\n\ntext(tree.tv, pretty = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important problem that arises during tree construction is that of split selection. When should the tree split a node into two further nodes and when not? Furthermore, when should the tree stop the splitting process entirely? In this respect, CART relies on the principle of impurity reduction: “The fundamental idea is to select each split of a subset so that the data in each of the descendent subsets are ‘purer’ than the data in the parent subset” (Breiman 1984: 23). A measure for node purity is the Gini index \\(G\\), which is defined as\n\\[\nG = \\sum_{k=1}^{K}{\\hat{p}_{mk}(1-\\hat{p}_{mk}),}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\hat{p}_{mk}\\) measures the proportion of observations of a response level \\(k\\) in the \\(m\\)th prediction area of the training data set. Values close to 0 are indicative of high node purity, meaning that most observations belong to the same class (e.g., Form = ty). If splitting a node no longer leads to a substantial increase in purity, it becomes the terminal node, i.e., it is not split further. This terminal node returns the tree’s class prediction.\nIt is worth noting that modern CART implementations rely on different splitting criteria. For instance, Conditional Inference Trees use the \\(p\\) values of internal association tests to identify which variables warrant further subdivision of the training data. The presence or absence of correlation thus also determines whether or not a given node will be terminal (for more details, see B. Greenwell 2022: 122).\n\n# Fitting a conditional inference tree\nctree.tv &lt;- ctree(Form ~ ., data = tv) # dot . means 'include all predictors'\n\nplot(ctree.tv)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n25.3.2 Regression trees\nRegression trees are used for continuous response variables. Instead of providing class predictions, they return the mean value of observations in a given prediction area. The algorithm now strives to minimize the residual sum of squares (\\(RSS\\)). Consider the regression tree for reaction times depending on word length, frequency and part of speech:\n\n# CART tree\ntree.rt &lt;- tree(RT ~ Length + Freq + POS, data = ELP)\n\nsummary(tree.rt)\n\n\nRegression tree:\ntree(formula = RT ~ Length + Freq + POS, data = ELP)\nVariables actually used in tree construction:\n[1] \"Freq\"   \"Length\"\nNumber of terminal nodes:  10 \nResidual mean deviance:  8629 = 7507000 / 870 \nDistribution of residuals:\n   Min. 1st Qu.

    "text": "25.4 Random forests\nRandom forests (Breiman 2001) belong to the class of ensemble methods because they combine simpler models (e.g., individual decision trees) into a more complex and possibly more accurate model. As part of the RF algorithm, a great number of decision trees is trained on bootstrapped samples of the training data.\nSo far, random forests are essentially identical with Bagging (= bootstrap aggregation); however, an important additional characteristic of the RF algorithm is that only a random subset of the predictors is taken into consideration at each split. According to Strobl et al. (2009: 332), the resulting variability in tree structure is advantageous: “By combining the prediction of such a diverse set of trees, ensemble methods utilize the fact that classification trees are unstable, but, on average, produce the right prediction”.\n\n25.4.1 Regression forest\nFor regression tasks, random forests return the average prediction of all trees in the ensemble.\n\n# For regression\nrt.rf.reg &lt;- randomForest(RT ~ Length + Freq + POS, data = ELP,\n                                mtry = 1, # = sqrt(number of variables)\n                                ntree = 500) # number of trees\n\nrt.rf.reg\n\n\nCall:\n randomForest(formula = RT ~ Length + Freq + POS, data = ELP,      mtry = 1, ntree = 500) \n               Type of random forest: regression\n                     Number of trees: 500\nNo. of variables tried at each split: 1\n\n          Mean of squared residuals: 8972.927\n                    % Var explained: 43.64\n\n# Conditional random forest\nrt.crf.reg &lt;- cforest(RT ~ Length + Freq + POS, data = ELP, \n                    controls = cforest_unbiased(ntree = 500, mtry = 1))\n\n\n\n25.4.2 Classification forest\nFor classification, all trees cast a vote for one of the response classes. The OOB error estimate refers to the accuracy of out-of-bag (OOB) predictions. After the initial bootstrapping procedure, roughly a third of the training data remains unused. These observations, which were not used for fitting trees, can be used as a test data set. Predictions based on this internal test data set are called OOB predictions.\n\n# For classification\ntv.rf.class &lt;- randomForest(Form ~ ., data = tv,\n                            mtry = 4,\n                            ntree = 500)\n\ntv.rf.class\n\n\nCall:\n randomForest(formula = Form ~ ., data = tv, mtry = 4, ntree = 500) \n               Type of random forest: classification\n                     Number of trees: 500\nNo. of variables tried at each split: 4\n\n        OOB estimate of  error rate: 18.86%\nConfusion matrix:\n   ty vy class.error\nty 86 22   0.2037037\nvy 21 99   0.1750000\n\n# Conditional random forest\ntv.crf.class &lt;- cforest(Form ~ ., data = tv,\n                    controls = cforest_unbiased(ntree = 500, mtry = 4))\n\ntv.crf.class\n\n\n     Random Forest using Conditional Inference Trees\n\nNumber of trees:  500 \n\nResponse:  Form \nInputs:  Film, Rel_Age, Rel_Sex, Rel_Power, Rel_Circle, S_Class, H_Class, S_Age, H_Age, Rel_Class, Before68, Others, Office, S_Sex, H_Sex, Place \nNumber of observations:  228 \n\n\n\n\n25.4.3 Variable importance\nRandom forests allow users to assess whether or not certain predictors are useful for the model. The Gini index can be re-used to identify those variables that have led to the greatest reduction in impurity. However, this measure is biased towards predictors with many values (cf. Strobl et al. 2007).\n\n# Gini importance (Reaction times)\nvarImpPlot(rt.rf.reg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Gini importance (Form of 2.p.)\nvarImpPlot(tv.rf.class)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more robust measure is (Conditional) Permutation Accuracy Importance which compares the predictive accuracy of the random forest model before and after randomly permuting the values of the predictors (cf. Strobl et al. 2008; Debeer and Strobl 2020).\n\n# Conditional permutation accuracy importance\nlibrary(\"permimp\")\n\n# Refit RF model with additional parameters\ntv.rf.class &lt;- randomForest(Form ~ .,\n                            data = tv,\n                            mtry = 4,\n                            ntree = 500,\n                            keep.inbag = TRUE,\n                            keep.forest = TRUE)\n\n# Compute CPI scores\ntv.rf.permimp &lt;- permimp(tv.rf.class, conditional = TRUE, progressBar = FALSE, threshold = .95) # Choose \"Yes\" in the console\n\n# Plot CPI scores\nplot(tv.rf.permimp, horizontal = TRUE, type = \"dot\", sort = TRUE)\n\n\n\n25.4.4 Visualising random forest models\nPartial dependence plots provide averaged predictions (\\(\\hat{y}\\)) for a given constellation of predictors.\nThese averages are produced by the partial dependence function \\(f_k\\). If a categorical response variable has \\(K\\) possible values, it has the form \\[\nf_k(X) = \\log [p_k (x)] - \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\log [p_k (x)],\n\\] with \\(p_k(x)\\) corresponding to the fitted probability of the 𝑘th level of the response variable for \\(k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., K\\}\\) (B.

    "text": "7.3 Word frequencies I\nYou are given the following token counts of English verb lemmas in the International Corpus of English.\n\n\n\nLemma\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nstart\n418\n\n\nenjoy\n139\n\n\nbegin\n337\n\n\nhelp\n281\n\n\n\nWhile this table is relatively small and easy to interpret, it is still a good idea to supply readers with a simple visual representation of the frequency distributions (e.g., a barplot.). Quite conveniently, R happens to provide us with an abundance of plotting functions! In order to make use of them, all we need to do is communicate to R the data we want to visualise. We can supply the data either\n\nby manually listing all the elements of interest or\nautomatically by importing it from an existing spreadsheet file (e.g., from Microsoft Excel).\n\nFor now, we will stick to option 1 and move on to option 2 in a later unit (cf. Section 10.2.2).\n\n7.3.1 Storing data in R\nTo create a two-dimensional plot, we will first need to generate two objects in R: one for the individual lemmas and one for the frequency counts.\nLet’s start by combining the lemmas start, enjoy, begin and help into an object lemma using R’s c() function. Enter the following line into a new R script and click on Run (or simply press Ctrl+Enter/Cmd+Enter).\n\nlemma &lt;- c(\"start\", \"enjoy\", \"begin\", \"help\")\n\nTo make sure this worked, we can apply the print() function to lemma to view the elements it holds:\n\nprint(lemma)\n\n[1] \"start\" \"enjoy\" \"begin\" \"help\" \n\n\nNaturally, it is also possible to combine numeric information with c().\n\nfrequency &lt;- c(418, 139, 337, 281)\n\nThe print() functions allows us to inspect the contents of frequency:\n\nprint(frequency)\n\n[1] 418 139 337 281\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen do I use quotation marks?\n\n\n\n\n\nLetters and numbers represent two distinct data types in R. Anything that should be understood as a simple sequence of letters must be enclosed by quotation marks \"...\". A linguistic item such as start will be will be evaluated as a string if it’s encoded as \"start\".\nNumbers (or integers), by contrast, appear without quotation marks.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Creating the barplot\nOur linguistic data is now stored in two variables lemma and frequency, which you can conceptualise as virtual container-like objects. These ‘containers’ are now showing in the Environment tab in the top right corner of your RStudio interface.\nThe combination of categorical labels and numeric information renders our data ideally suited for a barplot. R’s most basic barplot function (which is, unsurprisingly, called barplot()) needs at the very least …\n\na height argument, i.e., our y-axis values and\na names.arg argument, i.e., our x-axis labels.\n\n\nbarplot(frequency, names.arg = lemma)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter some tinkering, our plot looks more presentable:\n\nbarplot(frequency, names.arg = lemma, \n        main = \"Frequency of Lemmas\", # title\n        xlab = \"Lemmas\",  # label for x-axis\n        ylab = \"Frequency\", # label for y-axis\n        col = \"steelblue\") # color\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does ‘#’ mean? On comments in R\n\n\n\n\n\nIn R, everything followed by the hashtag # will be interpreted as a comment and won’t be evaluated by the R compiler. While comments don’t affect the output of our code in the slightest, they are crucial to any kind of programming project.\nAdding prose annotations will make your code not only easier to understand for others but also for your future self. Poor documentation is a common, yet unnecessary source of frustration for all parties involved …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn RStudio, you now have the option to save the plot to your computer. Once the figure has appeared in your “Plots” panel, you can click on “Export” in the menu bar below and proceed to choose the desired output format and file directory.\n\n\n7.3.3 Essential R concepts\nThe example above demonstrates one of the most important data structures in R: vectors. They form the cornerstone of various more complex objects such as data frames, and are essential to handling large data sets (e.g., corpora). And yet, vectors are very simple in that they are merely one-dimensional sequences of characters or numbers — no more, no less.\n\nprint(lemma)\n\n[1] \"start\" \"enjoy\" \"begin\" \"help\" \n\nprint(frequency)\n\n[1] 418 139 337 281\n\n\nThe individual elements in these two vectors are not randomly jumbling around in virtual space, but are in fact following a clear order. Each element comes with an “ID” (or index), by which it can be accessed. For example, if we want to print the first lemma in our lemma variable, we append square brackets [ ] to it. This will allow us to subset it.\n\nlemma[1]\n\n[1] \"start\"\n\n\nSimilarly, we can subset frequency according to, for example, its third element:\n\nfrequency[3]\n\n[1] 337\n\n\nIt is also possible to obtain entire ranges of elements, such as everything from the second to the fourth element:\n\nfrequency[2:4]\n\n[1] 139 337 281",

    "text": "5.1 Why learn R to begin with?\nWhen it comes to data analysis, learning R offers an overwhelming number of short- and long-term advantages over conventional spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc:\n\nFirst of all, it’s completely free. There’s no need to obtain any expensive licenses, as it is the case for commercial software such as SPSS or MS Excel.\nR makes it very easy to document and share every step of the analysis, thereby facilitating reproducible workflows.\nLarge (and by that I mean extremely large!) datasets pose no problems whatsoever. Loading tabular data with hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of rows only takes a few seconds, whereas most other software would crash.\nThere are numerous extensions that provide tailored functions for corpus linguistics that aren’t available in general-purpose spreadsheet software. This allows us to work with corpora, use complex search expression, perform part-of-speech annotation, dependency parsing, and much more – all from within R.\nR’s ggplot2 offers an incredibly powerful framework for data visualisation. Don’t believe it? Check out the ggplot2 gallery.\nThe CRAN repository features more than 20,000 packages that can be installed to expand the functionality of R almost indefinitely. Should none of them meet your needs, R gives you the tools to comfortably write and share your own functions and packages.",

    "text": "8.3 Word frequencies II\nRecall our corpus-linguistic data from the previous unit:\n\n\n\nLemma\nFrequency\n\n\n\n\nstart\n418\n\n\nenjoy\n139\n\n\nbegin\n337\n\n\nhelp\n281\n\n\n\nWe thought of the columns as one-dimensional, indexed lists of elements:\n\nlemma &lt;- c(\"start\", \"enjoy\", \"begin\", \"help\")\n\nfrequency &lt;- c(418, 139, 337, 281)\n\nActually, R allows us to combine these two vectors into something that resembles a real spreadsheet. To this end, we apply the data.frame() function to two vectors of our choice.\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(lemma, frequency)\n\nprint(data)\n\n  lemma frequency\n1 start       418\n2 enjoy       139\n3 begin       337\n4  help       281\n\n\n\n8.3.1 Essential R concepts\nThe variable data is no longer a vector, but a data frame (often abbreviated as ‘df’). Once again, each element carries its own label and can, therefore, be accessed or manipulated.\nSince we now have two dimensions, the subsetting notation in square brackets [ ] has to reflect that. This is the general pattern:\n\\[ df[row, column]\n\\tag{8.1}\\]\nSay, we’re looking for the element at the intersection of the first row and first column. Applying the pattern above, we can access it like so:\n\ndata[1,1]\n\n[1] \"start\"\n\n\nBut what if we need the entire first row? We simply omit the column part. Note, however, that the comma , needs to remain:\n\ndata[1,]\n\n  lemma frequency\n1 start       418\n\n\nSubsetting by columns is interesting. We can either use the square bracket notation [ ] or the column operator $:\n\ndata[,1]\n\n[1] \"start\" \"enjoy\" \"begin\" \"help\" \n\ndata$lemma\n\n[1] \"start\" \"enjoy\" \"begin\" \"help\" \n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Filtering\nNot all the information contained in a data frame is always relevant for our research. In those cases, it’s important to subset the rows and columns according to certain criteria.\nAssume we only need those observations where the lemma frequencies are greater than 300. We can obtain those by specifying\n\nthe data frame,\nthe column of interest and\nthe condition to apply.\n\nYou can read the code below as\n\nTake the data frame data and subset it according to the column data$frequency. Show me those rows where the values of data$frequency are greater than 300.\n\n\ndata[data$frequency &gt; 300, ]\n\n  lemma frequency\n1 start       418\n3 begin       337\n\n\nWhat if we wanted to filter by lemma instead? Let’s say we’re looking for frequency data on the verbs start and help.\nThis will give us the row associated with start:\n\ndata[data$lemma == \"start\", ]\n\n  lemma frequency\n1 start       418\n\n\nCombining multiple statements requires a logical operator. Here we’re using | , which corresponds to a logical ‘or’ (disjunction).\n\ndata[data$lemma == \"start\" | data$lemma == \"help\", ]\n\n  lemma frequency\n1 start       418\n4  help       281\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we need to use “or” (|) and not “and” (&)?\n\n\n\nThe idea of combining statements somewhat naturally suggests a conjunction, which could be achieved via &. How come R doesn’t return anything if we do it that way?\n\ndata[data$lemma == \"start\" & data$lemma == \"help\", ]\n\n[1] lemma     frequency\n&lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.3 I don’t like the way this looks – is there another way to filter in R?\nYes, absolutely. The subsections below demonstrate a few popular alternatives. In the end, the exact way you filter doesn’t really matter, so long as you (as well as the people who have to work with your script) can understand what you’re trying to achieve. Always consider adding comments to your filtering operations!\n\n8.3.3.1 subset()\nAlmost every subsetting operation we perform with square brackets can also be performed using the subset() function. Here are some expressions that are synonymous to the ones above:\n\nsubset(data, frequency &gt; 300)\n\n  lemma frequency\n1 start       418\n3 begin       337\n\nsubset(data, lemma == \"start\" | lemma == \"help\")\n\n  lemma frequency\n1 start       418\n4  help       281\n\n\n\n\n8.3.3.2 tidyverse\nThe tidyverse-ecosystem is a collection of packages specifically designed for handling typical data science tasks as comfortably and elegantly as possible, supplying countless helper functions for data manipulation, transformation and visualisation. Installation instructions are provided in Section 9.2.1.\nIt offers some appealing alternatives to the Base R subsetting functions. Let’s generate a tidyverse-style data frame, the tibble:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ndata2 &lt;- tibble(\n  lemma = c(\"start\", \"enjoy\", \"begin\", \"help\"),\n  frequency = c(418, 139, 337, 281)\n)\n\nprint(data2)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 2\n  lemma frequency\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 start       418\n2 enjoy       139\n3 begin       337\n4 help        281\n\n\nWe can single out certain columns by using select():\n\nselect(data2, lemma)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 1\n  lemma\n  &lt;chr&gt;\n1 start\n2 enjoy\n3 begin\n4 help \n\n\nIt is very easy to filter the data frame according to certain criteria:\n\nfilter(data2, frequency &gt; 300)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  lemma frequency\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 start       418\n2 begin       337\n\nfilter(data2, lemma == \"start\" | lemma == \"help\")\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  lemma frequency\n  &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 start       418\n2 help        281\n\n\nA extensive guide to the main tidyverse functions is provided in Chapter 3 of the free eBook R For Data Science (2nd edition).",

    "text": "19.3 The \\(\\chi^2\\)-test\nHaving clearly stated our hypotheses in the previous unit, the next step is to compute a test statistic that indicates how strongly our data conforms to \\(H_0\\). For instance, the Pearson \\(\\chi^2\\) statistic is commonly used for categorical data.\nIt requires two types of values: the observed frequencies \\(n_{ij}\\) (for \\(1, ..., n\\)) in our data set and the expected frequencies \\(m_{ij}\\) (for \\(1, ..., m\\)), which we would expect to see if \\(H_0\\) were true. The indices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) uniquely identify the frequencies found in all column-row combinations of a cross-table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical details: The structure of a contingency table\n\n\n\n\n\nThe table below represents a generic contingency table where \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are categorical variables. Each \\(x_i\\) represents a category of \\(X\\) and each \\(y_j\\) represents a category of \\(Y\\).

Consider a continuous variable \\(X\\) with observations \\(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\\) from a sample of size \\(n\\). The sample mean \\(\\bar{x}\\) then corresponds to\n\\[\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n} \\\\ = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHold on, what does this large Σ symbol mean?\n\n\n\nThe summation symbol \\(\\sum\\) is a concise way to express the sum of a sequence of numbers. It works like this:\n\nThe expression below the \\(\\sum\\) (e.g., \\(i = 1\\)) indicates the starting value of the index \\(i\\).\nThe number above the \\(\\sum\\) (e.g., \\(n\\)) is the ending value of the index \\(i\\).\nThe expression to the right of the \\(\\sum\\) (e.g., \\(x_i\\)) is the term to be summed.\n\nFor instance, the expression \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i}\\) means “sum the values of \\(x_i\\) starting from \\(i = 1\\) up to \\(i = n\\).” In other words, it adds up the values \\(x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_n\\).\n\n\nIn R, we can obtain the average value of a numeric vector with the mean() function. Let’s do that for the length of main clauses found in the cl.order data:\n\nmean(cl.order$LEN_MC)\n\n[1] 9.265509\n\n\nThe output returned by this function provides a one-value summary of all observations contained in LEN_MC. How could we visualise it?\nFirst, let’s create a histogram of LEN_MC. Histograms summarise how often certain values occur in a continuous variable. The blue line indicates the sample mean. Alternatively, you can use a density plot to represent the probability of encountering a specific value in the data.\n\nHistogram (ggplot2)Density plot (ggplot2)Histogram (Base R)Density plot (Base R)\n\n\n\n# Plot distribution of LEN_MC\ncl.length.hist &lt;- ggplot(cl.order, aes(x = LEN_MC)) +\n                  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)\n\ncl.length.hist +\n  # Add mean\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(LEN_MC)),\n             color = \"steelblue\",\n             linewidth = 1) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot distribution of LEN_MC\ncl.length.dens &lt;- ggplot(cl.order, aes(x = LEN_MC)) +\n                  geom_density()\n\ncl.length.dens +\n  # Add mean\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(LEN_MC)),\n             color = \"steelblue\",\n             linewidth = 1) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhist(cl.order$LEN_MC)\n  abline(v=mean(cl.order$LEN_MC),lwd=3, col = \"steelblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(density(cl.order$LEN_MC))\n  abline(v=mean(cl.order$LEN_MC),lwd=3, col = \"steelblue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2.2 The median\nThe median() function computes the “the halfway point of the data (50% of the data are above the median; 50% of the data are below” (Winter 2020: 58).\n\\[\n\\tilde{x}_{0.5} =\n\\begin{cases}\nx_{((n+1)/2)} & \\text{if } n \\text{ is odd.} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2}(x_{n/2}+x_{(n/2+1)}) & \\text{if } n \\text{ is even.}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nmedian(cl.order$LEN_MC)\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nThe median of LEN_MC is represented by the red vertical line.\n\nHistogram (ggplot2)Density plot (ggplot2)Histogram (Base R)Density plot (Base R)\n\n\n\ncl.length.hist +\n  # Add mean\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(LEN_MC)), color = \"steelblue\", linewidth = 1) +\n  # Add median\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(LEN_MC)), color = \"red\", linewidth = 1) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncl.length.dens +\n  # Add mean\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(LEN_MC)), color = \"steelblue\", linewidth = 1) +\n  # Add median\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(LEN_MC)), color = \"red\", linewidth = 1) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhist(cl.order$LEN_MC)\n  abline(v=mean(cl.order$LEN_MC),lwd=3, col = \"steelblue\")\n  abline(v=median(cl.order$LEN_MC),lwd=3, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot(density(cl.order$LEN_MC))\n  abline(v=mean(cl.order$LEN_MC),lwd=3, col = \"steelblue\")\n  abline(v=mean(cl.order$LEN_MC),lwd=3, col = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2.3 Sample variance and standard deviation\nIn order to assess how well the mean represents the data, it is instructive to compute the variance var() and the standard deviation sd() for a sample.\nThe sample variance \\(s^2\\) is defined as\n\\[s^2 = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}. \\]\nIn other words, it stands for the average squared deviation of all observations from the sample mean.\n\nvar(cl.order$LEN_MC)\n\n[1] 25.12585\n\n\nCorrespondingly, the standard deviation of the mean is the square root of the variance (cf. Heumann, Schomaker, and Shalabh 2022: 51-2).\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i - \\bar{x})^2}} \\]\n\nsd(cl.order$LEN_MC)\n\n[1] 5.012569\n\n\nVisualisation:\n\nExample 1Example 2\n\n\n\ncl.length.hist +\n  # Add verticle line for the mean\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(LEN_MC)), color = \"steelblue\", linewidth = 1) +\n  # Add -1sd\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(LEN_MC) - sd(LEN_MC)), color = \"orange\", linewidth = 1) +\n  # Add +1sd\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(LEN_MC) + sd(LEN_MC)), color = \"orange\", linewidth = 1) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create data frame with mean and sd for each clause ORDER\n\ncl.order %&gt;% \n  # Select variables of interest\n  select(ORDER, LEN_MC) %&gt;% \n  # Group results of following operations by ORDER\n  group_by(ORDER) %&gt;% \n    # Create grouped summary of mean and sd for each ORDER\n    summarise(mean = mean(LEN_MC),\n                sd = sd(LEN_MC)) -&gt; cl_mean_sd; cl_mean_sd\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  ORDER  mean    sd\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 mc-sc  9.04  4.91\n2 sc-mc  9.75  5.22\n\n# Plot results \n\nggplot(cl_mean_sd, aes(x = ORDER, y = mean)) +\n  # Barplot with a specific variable mapped onto y-axis\n  geom_col() +\n  # Add mean and standard deviation to the plot\n  geom_errorbar(aes(x = ORDER,\n                    ymin = mean-sd,\n                    ymax = mean+sd), width = .2) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(y = \"Mean length of main clauses\", x = \"Clause order\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2.4 Quantiles\nWhile median() divides the data into two equal sets (i.e., two 50% quantiles), the quantile() function makes it possible to partition the data further.\n\nquantile(cl.order$LEN_MC)\n\n  0%  25%  50%  75% 100% \n   2    6    8   11   31 \n\n\nquantile(x, 0) and quantile(x, 1) thus show the minimum and maximum values, respectively.\n\nquantile(cl.order$LEN_MC, 0)\n\n0% \n 2 \n\nquantile(cl.order$LEN_MC, 1)\n\n100% \n  31 \n\n\n\n\n16.2.5 Quartiles and boxplots\nConsider the distribution of clause length by clause order:\n\nBoxplot (Base R)Boxplot (ggplot2)\n\n\n\nboxplot(LEN_MC ~ ORDER, cl.order)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(cl.order, aes(x = ORDER, y = LEN_MC)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompare it to the corresponding rotated density plot:\n\nggplot(cl.order, aes(x = LEN_MC, fill = ORDER)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic()",
