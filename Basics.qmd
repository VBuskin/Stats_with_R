## @barbieriOlderMenYounger2007: Older Men and Younger Women

### Defining the Variable

New quotatives in American English: *be like*, *go*, *be all*:

(1) "*I was like* 'well if it’s not leaking, I don’t care.'"
(2) "Do you, I asked I was running out and I *go*, 'you’re trying to
    deliver a pizza here?'"
(3) "My sister’s *all* 'excuse me would you mind if I gave you, if I
    want your autograph.'"

## Task

As you read through the following sections, think about **what might go
wrong** at each stage of the study!
:::

### Reviewing Previous Research

-   Previous results with regard to **age**: *Be like* is known to be
    preferred by **younger speakers**.
-   Previous results with regard to **sex** are **inconclusive**.

### Research Question

> "The study aims to contribute to the investigation of the
> controversial question of the effect of **speaker’s age** and **sex**
> on quotative use in American English, focusing on the newer quotatives
> *be like*, *go*, *be all*" [@barbieriOlderMenYounger2007: 26].

### Data

-   **Choice of corpus**: 450,000 words taken from the Conversation
    component of the *Longman Spoken and Written English Corpus* (all
    files where the age and gender of speakers were available), i.e.,
    about 50 hours of casual conversation coded for speakers' **age**
    and **sex**.
-   **Data extraction**: All forms of *be like*, *be all*, *go*, *say*
    extracted using corpus linguistic software; data entered into
    spreadsheet software; word counts of texts added via Delphi program.

### Formulation of Results

> "In sum, the patterns of proportional use and the results of the
> statistical analyses show that there are striking differences in the
> way that men and women under the age of forty use quotative verbs. In
> contrast, in conforming to the traditional quotative *say*, men and
> women over forty displayed similar behavior"
> [@barbieriOlderMenYounger2007: 38–39].

### Some of her conclusions

> "In favoring *be like* over other quotatives, men in their late 20s
> and in their 30s display an 'affinity' with slightly younger women,
> women in their early 20s, rather than with women of their same age"
> [@barbieriOlderMenYounger2007: 41].

## Principles of Empirical Linguistics

-   **Objectivity** — Independence from researchers or devices (→
    replicability!)

-   **Reliability** — Studies should be replicable.

-   **Validity** — A study must actually address the problem formulated
    in the research question.
