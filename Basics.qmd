## Barbieri (2008): Older Men and Younger Women

### Defining the Variable

New quotatives in American English: *be like*, *go*, *be all*:

(1) "*I was like* 'well if it’s not leaking, I don’t care.'"
(2) "Do you, I asked I was running out and I *go*, 'you’re trying to
    deliver a pizza here?'"
(3) "My sister’s *all* 'excuse me would you mind if I gave you, if I
    want your autograph.'"

### Reviewing Previous Research

-   Previous results with regard to **age**: *Be like* is known to be
    preferred by **younger speakers**.
-   Previous results with regard to **sex** are **inconclusive**.

### Research Question

> "The study aims to contribute to the investigation of the controversial
question of the effect of **speaker’s age** and **sex** on quotative use
in American English, focusing on the newer quotatives *be like*, *go*,
*be all*."

### Data

-   **Choice of corpus**: 450,000 words taken from the Conversation
    component of the *Longman Spoken and Written English Corpus* (all
    files where the age and gender of speakers were available), i.e.,
    about 50 hours of casual conversation coded for speakers' **age**
    and **sex**.
-   **Data extraction**: All forms of *be like*, *be all*, *go*, *say*
    extracted using corpus linguistic software; data entered into
    spreadsheet software; word counts of texts added via Delphi program.

### Presentation of Results

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Quotatives Across Sex and Age Groups (Normed Frequency per 100,000 Words)"
#| 
# Load necessary library
library(ggplot2)

# Data from the table
data <- data.frame(
  Group = c("Men 16-26", "Women 16-26", "Men 27-40", "Women 27-40"),
  Frequency = c(500, 1200, 450, 300)
)

# Creating the barplot
ggplot(data, aes(x = Group, y = Frequency, fill = Group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Quotatives by Age and Sex Groups",
       x = "Group",
       y = "Normed Frequency (per 100,000 words)") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```

### Formulation of Results

> "In sum, the patterns of proportional use and the results of the
statistical analyses show that there are striking differences in the way
that men and women under the age of forty use quotative verbs. In
contrast, in conforming to the traditional quotative *say*, men and
women over forty displayed similar behavior" (38-39)

### Some of her conclusions

> "In favoring *be like* over other quotatives, men in their late 20s and in their 30s display an 'affinity' with slightly younger women, women in their early 20s, rather than with women of their same age" (41).

## Principles of Empirical Linguistics

-   **Objectivity** — Independence from researchers or devices (→
    replicability!)

-   **Reliability** — Studies should be replicable.

-   **Validity** — A study must actually address the problem formulated
    in the research question.
