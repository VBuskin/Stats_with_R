## Preparation

Please download the file `Paquot_Larsson_2020_data.xlsx`
[@paquotDescriptiveStatisticsVisualization2020][^categorical_data-1] and
store it in the same folder as your currently active R-script. Then run
the code lines below:

[^categorical_data-1]: The original supplementary materials can be
    downloaded from the publisher's
    [website](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-46216-1_17)

library("tidyverse") # data manipulation and visualisation

# Load data from working directory
cl.order <- read_xlsx("Paquot_Larsson_2020_data.xlsx")

## Frequency tables

### One variable

Each categorical variable in the data frame is made up of two or more
categories. A simple descriptive measure is the frequency of each
category. The table below indicates how often each clause order occurs
in the `ORDER` column.

```{r}
order_freq1 <- table(cl.order$ORDER) 

print(order_freq1)
```

The notation `cl.order$ORDER` subsets the `cl.order` according to the
column `ORDER` (see [data frames](Data_frames.qmd)).

Alternatively, you could use `xtabs()` to achieve the same result --
perhaps with a slightly more intuitive syntax.

```{r}
order_freq2 <- xtabs(~ ORDER, cl.order)

print(order_freq2)
```

### Two or more variables

If we are interested in the relationship between **multiple categorical
variables**, we can cross-tabulate the frequencies of their categories.
For example, what is the distribution of clause order depending on the
type of subordinate clause? The output is also referred to as a
**contingency table**.

```{r}
order_counts1 <- table(cl.order$ORDER, cl.order$SUBORDTYPE)

print(order_counts1)
```

Here is the `xtabs()` alternative:

```{r}
order_counts2 <- xtabs(~ ORDER + SUBORDTYPE, cl.order)

print(order_counts2)
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="How do I obtain percentage tables?"}
There are two ways to convert the raw frequency counts to percentage
tables:

1.  Manually divide all cells by the total number of observations (which
    correspond to the sum of all cells) and multiply the result by 100.

```{r, output = FALSE}
pct1 <- order_counts1/sum(order_counts1) * 100
```

2.  Use the `prop.table()` function and multiply the result by 100.

```{r, output = FALSE}
pct2 <- prop.table(order_counts1) * 100
```

## Plotting categorical data

This section demonstrates both the in-built plotting functions of R
('Base R') as well as the more modern versions provided by the
`tidyverse` package.

### Moscaiplot

A straightforward way to visualise a contingency table is the
mosaicplot:

```{r}
mosaicplot(order_counts2, color = TRUE)
```

### Barplots

The workhorse of categorical data analysis is the barplot. Base R
functions usually require a `table` object as input, whereas `ggplot2`
can operate on the raw dataset.

### One variable

::: panel-tabset
### Base R

-   Base R barplot with `barplot()`; requires the counts as computed by
    `tables()` or `xtabs()`

```{r}
# Generate cross-table
order_freq1 <- table(cl.order$ORDER)

# Create barplot
barplot(order_freq1)
```

### ggplot2

-   Barplot with `geom_bar()` using the raw input data

```{r, echo = TRUE, output = TRUE}
# Load library  (if not already loaded)
library(tidyverse)

# Create barplot
ggplot(cl.order, aes(x = ORDER)) +
  geom_bar()
```
:::

### Two variables

Bivariate barplots can be obtained by either supplying a contingency
table (Base R) or by mapping the second variable onto the `fill`
argument using the raw data.

::: panel-tabset
### Base R

```{r}
# Generate cross-table
order_counts2 <- xtabs(~ ORDER + SUBORDTYPE, cl.order)

# Create barplot
barplot(order_counts2, 
        beside = TRUE,  # Make bars side-by-side
        legend = TRUE)  # Add a legend
```

### Base R (fully customised)

```{r}
# Generate cross-table
order_counts2 <- xtabs(~ ORDER + SUBORDTYPE, cl.order)

# Create barplot
barplot(order_counts2, 
        beside = TRUE,  # Make bars dodged (i.e., side by side)
        main = "Distribution of ORDER by SUBORDTYPE (Base R)", 
        xlab = "ORDER", 
        ylab = "Frequency", 
        col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"), # Customize colors
        legend = TRUE,  # Add a legend
        args.legend = list(title = "SUBORDTYPE", x = "topright"))
```

### ggplot2

```{r, echo = TRUE, output = TRUE}
# Load library (if not already loaded)
library(tidyverse)

# Create barplot
ggplot(cl.order, aes(x = ORDER, fill = SUBORDTYPE)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

### ggplot2 (fully customised)

```{r, echo = TRUE, output = TRUE}
# Load library (if not already loaded)
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(cl.order, aes(x = ORDER, fill = SUBORDTYPE)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Clause order by subordinate clause type",
    x = "Clause order",
    y = "Frequency",
    fill = "Type of subordinate clause"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```
:::

## Plotting percentages

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="How do I plot percentages in Base R?"}
In very much the same way as with the raw counts:

```{r}
# Create barplot
barplot(pct1, 
        beside = TRUE,  # Make bars side-by-side
        legend = TRUE)  # Add a legend
```
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="How do I plot percentages with `ggplot2`?"}
Here, a few tweaks are necessary. In general, the `ggplot()` function
prefers to works with data frames rather than cross-tables, so we'll
have to coerce it into one first:

```{r}
# Convert pct1 to a data frame
pct1_df <- as.data.frame(pct1)

colnames(pct1_df) <- c("ORDER", "SUBORDTYPE", "pct")

# Print contents of the new data frame "pct1_df"
print(pct1_df)
```

Now we can plot the percentages with `geom_col()`. This geom (=
'geometric object') allows us to manually specify what should be mapped
onto the y-axis:

```{r}
# Load library  (if not already loaded)
library(tidyverse)

# Create barplot with user-defined y-axis (requires geom_col())
ggplot(pct1_df, aes(x = ORDER, y = pct, fill = SUBORDTYPE)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```
:::

## Other plots

### Bubble plot

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

library(tidyverse)

# Bubble plot
ggplot(pct1_df, aes(x = ORDER, y = SUBORDTYPE, size = pct)) +
  geom_point(color = "skyblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(5, 20)) +  # Adjust bubble size range
  labs(title = "Bubble Plot of ORDER by SUBORDTYPE",
       x = "ORDER",
       y = "SUBORDTYPE",
       size = "Percentage") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Alluvial plot

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# Make sure to install this library prior to loading 
library(ggalluvial)

ggplot(pct1_df,
       aes(axis1 = ORDER, axis2 = SUBORDTYPE, y = pct)) +
  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = ORDER), width = 0.3, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_stratum(width = 0.4, fill = "gray", color = "black") +
  geom_text(stat = "stratum", aes(label = after_stat(stratum))) +
  labs(title = "Alluvial Plot of ORDER by SUBORDTYPE",
       x = "Categories", y = "Percentage") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Exporting tables to MS Word

The `flextable` package greatly facilitates generating publication-ready
tables in R. It provides the best output if used on a table created by
`xtabs()`. The full guide to this package can be found
[here](https://ardata-fr.github.io/flextable-book/crosstabs.html#using-tables).

```{r, output = FALSE}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# Load library after installation
library(flextable)

# Create a table
tab1 <- xtabs(~ ORDER + SUBORDTYPE, cl.order)

# Convert a table to a flextable with as_flextable()
output_1 <- as_flextable(tab1)

# Print output
print(output_1)
```

![](crosstable_plot1.png)

Unfortunately, the output cannot really be customised. However, if you'd
like to add some further options, the `crosstable` package provides a
remedy. In fact, it is even easier to use as it doesn't require you to
compute any tables beforehand.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

# Required libraries
library(crosstable)
library(flextable)

# Create the cross table
output2 <- crosstable(cl.order, ORDER, by = SUBORDTYPE, 
                 total = "both",
                 percent_digits = 2)

as_flextable(output2)

```
