## Do's

::: callout-tip
-   (Re-)read a published sociolinguistic study (e.g., @barbieriOlderMenYounger2007) before you start writing.

-   Try to write a good first and a good last sentence.

-   Papers should be written in clear and concise English.

-   Use **many examples** from your corpus in the results section.

-   Provide a **plagiarism declaration** signed by you (e.g "Ich habe die vorliegende Arbeit selbständig verfasst und keine anderen als die angegebenen Quellen und Hilfsmittel benutzt.")

-   Discuss **pros and cons of your corpus** [cf. @lange_corpus_2020: Chapter 4]
:::

## Don'ts

::: callout-important
**General content and style**

-   An overly general introduction

-   No obvious coherence between corpus and linguistic phenomenon

-   Narrative elements: *First, I thought that... But then, I decided that...*

-   Trivial statements: *The gender is very important in the field of linguistics.*

-   "Steep" introductions

-   Opinions presented as facts

-   Biographies, historical details with no relation to your topics, overly long summaries of textbooks, etc.

-   Sweeping conclusions

**Statistics**

-   Use of variables in the results section that have not been prepared and introduced in the background section.

-   Figures or tables that are not discussed in the text.

-   Comparisons of non-normalized raw frequency data: use percentages!

-   Graphs based on raw data: use percentages!

-   Figures without corresponding percentage tables, percentage tables without corresponding figures, or percentages without raw data.

### Language

-   Avoid expressions like *a lot of*.

-   Avoid contractions: *won't*, *doesn't*, *mustn't*, etc.

-   Avoid overly verbose and pompous language.

### Structure

-   Avoid placing content or results in the introduction, the methods section, or the background section.

-   Avoid repetition of arguments (e.g., in introduction and background sections).

### Form

-   Avoid sloppy formatting of the table of contents.

-   Avoid different fonts in the paper (e.g., footnotes, page numbers, graphs, tables, etc.).

-   Don't forget to use italics when referring to linguistic entities (e.g., the verb *eat*).

-   Avoid spelling mistakes in your references.

-   Avoid using accents instead of apostrophes: English apostrophe: *Don’t* vs. accent (e.g., in French): *é, è*. Wrong: *Don´t*, *Don\`t*.

-   Avoid CAPITALS if you actually want to use small capitals.

-   Avoid using the past tense for quotations: *Chomsky (1957) claims that...* rather than *Chomsky (1957) claimed that...*.

### References

-   Avoid sources from the internet/unpublished sources/sources which have not gone through a peer review process.

-   Avoid indirect references: quoting Labov using someone else's quotation of Labov.

### General

1.  No collaboration.

2.  No plagiarism.

3.  No ghost writers.
