# First steps {.unnumbered}

This collection of handouts provides a hands-on introduction to data
analysis and statistical methods in quantitative corpus linguistics with
R. It requires a working installation of both **R** and **RStudio**.

It is geared primarily towards students attending the classes **Language
Variation** (BA) and **Statistics for Linguistics** (MA) as well as
those currently working on their **BA/MA/PhD theses** in empirical
linguistics.

## Installing R

First, we need to download [R](https://ftp.fau.de/cran/). The link will
take you to the homepage of the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)
where you can download the binary distribution. Choose the one that
corresponds to your operating system (Windows/MAC/Linux).

Click "Download R for Windows" $\rightarrow$ Select "base" $\rightarrow$
Click on "Download R-4.4.1 for Windows" (or whatever most recent version
is currently displayed).

Open the set-up file you've just downloaded and simply follow the
instructions on screen. It's fine to go with the default options.

## Installing RStudio

You can now download and install
[RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). RStudio is a
so-called "Integrated Development Environment" (IDE), which will provide
us with a variety of helpful tools to write and edit code comfortably.
If R was a musical instrument, then RStudio would be the recording
studio, so-to-speak.
