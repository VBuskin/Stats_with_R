## Preface {.unnumbered}

This collection of handouts provides a hands-on introduction to data
analysis and statistical methods in quantitative corpus linguistics with
R. It is designed with accessibility in mind, assuming no prior
knowledge of programming or statistics. All you need to get started is a
laptop; everything else will be explained within these pages.

Primarily, this reader is geared towards students attending the classes
**Language Variation** (BA) and **Statistics for Linguistics** (MA) at
the Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt (Germany). However, it
is also meant to equip students currently working on their **BA/MA/PhD
theses** with the tools they need to conduct empirical studies on a wide
array of linguistic phenomena. The methods presented here reflect the
state-of-the-art in corpus-linguistic research, providing readers with
current and relevant analytical techniques.

## Overview {.unnumbered}

We begin by establishing the general structure of corpus-linguistic
studies, accompanied by key theoretical and practical considerations.
The second section introduces R as an analytical tool, covering its core
functionality. With these fundamentals in place, we proceed to query
corpora directly within R. Chapters four and five focus on describing
discrete and continuous outputs, as well as identifying meaningful
associations and differences in the data. Finally, to gain more nuanced
insights into potential patterns, we apply common machine learning
algorithms to fit, evaluate, and interpret statistical models.

Throughout this journey, readers will develop the skills to conduct
robust corpus-linguistic analyses, from basic querying to advanced
statistical modeling.
