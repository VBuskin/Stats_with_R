For instance, it\n    does not matter which value of `SUBORDTYPE` or `MORETHAN2CL` comes\n    first or last:\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    unique(cl.order$SUBORDTYPE)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] \"temp\" \"caus\"\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    \n    ```{.r .cell-code}\n    unique(cl.order$MORETHAN2CL)\n    ```\n    \n    ::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n    \n    ```\n    [1] \"no\"  \"yes\"\n    ```\n    \n    \n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n-   **ordinal**: Such variables can be ordered, but the intervals\n    between their individuals values are not meaningful. Heumann\n    [-@heumann_introduction_2022: 6] provides a pertinent example:\n\n    \"\\[T\\]he satisfaction with a product (unsatisfied–satisfied–very\n    satisfied) is an ordinal variable because the values this variable\n    can take can be ordered but the differences between\n    'unsatisfied–satisfied' and 'satisfied–very satisfied' cannot be\n    compared in a numerical way\".\n\n-   In the case of **interval**-scaled variables, the differences\n    between the values can be interpreted, but their ratios must be\n    treated with caution. A temperature of 4°C is 6 degrees warmer than\n    -2°C; however, this does not imply that 4°C is three times warmer\n    than -2°C. This is because the temperature scale has no true zero\n    point; 0°C simply signifies another point on the scale and not the\n    absence of temperature altogether.\n\n-   **Ratio**-scaled variables allow both a meaningful interpretation of\n    the differences between their values and (!) of the ratios between\n    them. Within the context of clause length, `LENGTH_DIFF` values such\n    as 4 and 8 not only suggest that the latter is four units greater\n    than the former but also that their ratio $\\frac{8}{4} = 2$ is a\n    valid way to describe the relationship between these values. Here a\n    `LENGTH_DIFF` of 0 can be clearly viewed as the absence of a length\n    difference.\n\n",
