The research question is as follows:\n\n> Do people tend to exhibit gender bias in pronoun use (e.g. *he* or\n> *she*) when referring to professionals in leadership roles?\n\nAs a result, one can either expect to see pronouns used in a way that\naligns with traditional gender stereotypes, or notice efforts to\ncounteract such biases by adopting more inclusive and neutral language.\nNevertheless, the pronouns that are being analysed can only be female or\nmale and thus, they represent the required structure for a binomial\ndistribution (*he* or *she*), which is binary data.\n\nA test that is built on the assumptions of the binomial distribution is\ncalled the **Binomial Test**. The Binomial Test calculates the likelihood of\nobserving a particular pronoun (e.g., *he*) being used to refer to\nprofessionals in leadership roles, under the assumption of a given\nexpected proportion, and assesses whether the observed frequency differs\nsignificantly from the expected one.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Is this approach suitable for my research?\n\nIf you are working with corpus-based frequency data that involves binary\ncategories (yes or no, male or female, VO or OV, British or\nUS-American,...) and if you have a specific probability of success which\nis specified in your hypotheses and does not change from one trial to\nthe next, then this approach is working for you and will lead to\nsuccessful results.\n:::\n\n## Understanding the Binomial Distribution (Cumulative Mass Function (CMF) Version)\n\nThe binomial distribution is used to calculate the probability of\nobserving up to and including $x$ successes in $n$ trials, given a fixed\nprobability of success $P$. This calculation is conducted using the\n**Cumulative Mass Function** (CMF), which is a running total of\nprobabilities. The CMF is a valuable tool for calculating probabilities\nfor ranges, such as \"what is the probability of 0 to 3 successes?\" as\nopposed to the probability of a specific number of successes (see\n@eq-binom). [^binomial_test-1]\n\n[^binomial_test-1]: For more information on the binomial test using a\n    specific number of successes, please refer to The Probability Mass\n    Function PMF.\n\n$$ P(x;n,P) = \\sum_{i=1}^{|x|}\\bigg[\\binom{n}{i} p^i (1-P)^{n-i}\\bigg]\n$$ {#eq-binom}\n\n-   Key elements:\n    -   $x$: The maximum number of successes that is of interest (e.g.,\n        up to 3 successes).\n    -   $n$: The total number of trials (e.g., total observations or\n        experiments).\n    -   $P$: The probability of success in each trial (e.g., the chance\n        of using *he* when describing a professional).\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Linguistic example\n\nImagine studying gender bias in pronoun use. If $P = 0.5$ (i.e., the\nprobability of obtaining the masculine pronoun), and you observe up to 3\nuses of *he* out of 10 trials, the CMF calculates the probability of\ngetting 0, 1, 2, or 3 successes (usage of *he*) combined.\n:::\n\n## Using the Binomial Test (CMF-Version) in Linguistic Research\n\nThe CMF is especially useful when testing hypotheses about ranges of\noutcomes.\n\nSteps for a Binomial Test Using the CMF:\n\n1. Hypotheses\n\n-   Null hypothesis ($H_0$): The observed data matches the expected\n    cumulative probability. Therefore: The observed frequency of the\n    pronouns *he* and *she* referring to professionals in leadership\n    roles corresponds with the expected proportion of 50% each,\n    indicating that both pronouns are being used equally.\n\n-   Alternative hypothesis ($H_1$): The observed data deviates from\n    the expected cumulative probability. Therefore: The observed\n    frequency of the pronouns *he* and *she* referring to professionals\n    in leadership roles deviates from the expected proportion of 50%\n    each, indicating a gender bias.\n\n2. Performing the test in R by using the cumulative probabilities\n\n-   Example: To calculate the probability of observing up to 3 successes\n    in 10 trials with P=0.5 each, the following code should be used:\n\n```         \npbinom(3,10,0.5)\n```\n\n3\\. Interpreting the results:\n\n-   A p-value smaller than 0.05 indicates a significant deviation from\n    the expected probability\n\n-   The test helps to determine whether the observed data can be used to\n    reject the H0.\n\n-   Checking the confidence interval (CI) provides the range of likely\n    values for the true success probability\n\n::: callout-tip\n## The Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n\nThis function is used to calculate the probability of observing exactly\nx successes in n trials, given a fixed probability of success P.\n\n$$ \n\\begin{align}\nf(x; n, P) & = \\binom{n}{x} P^x (1-P)^{n-x} \\\\\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nTo calculate the PMF binomial distributions in R, the following code\nshould be used:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndbinom(x = 3, size = 10, prob = 0.5)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.1171875\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n## One-Sided vs. Two-Sided Tests\n\nThe choice between one-sided and two-sided tests depends on the research\nquestion.\n\n-   One-Sided Test: Used only for analysing deviations in one direction.\n\n    -   Example: Is a participant's performance better than chance?\n\n-   Two-Sided Test: Used for analysing deviations in both directions.\n\n    -   Example: Is the frequency of male pronouns different from the\n        frequency of female pronouns? (The result can either be that the\n        frequency of male pronouns is higher than the frequency of\n        female pronouns or that they are less frequent than female\n        pronouns.)\n\nTwo-Sided Binomial Test\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbinom.test(x = 15, n = 20, p = 0.5, alternative = \"two.sided\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tExact binomial test\n\ndata:  15 and 20\nnumber of successes = 15, number of trials = 20, p-value = 0.04139\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.5089541 0.9134285\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n                  0.75 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne-Sided Binomial Test\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbinom.test(x = 15, n = 20, p = 0.5, alternative = \"greater\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tExact binomial test\n\ndata:  15 and 20\nnumber of successes = 15, number of trials = 20, p-value = 0.02069\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.5\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.5444176 1.0000000\nsample estimates:\nprobability of success \n                  0.75 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Please note\n\nThe function `binom.test()` in R only uses the CMF function.\n:::\n\n## Comparing Two Groups: Proportion Tests\n\nFor the comparison of proportions between two groups, the prop.test()\nfunction can be used.\n\nExample: An experiment is being conducted, in which participants have to\ndetermine whether a word they are being shown is an actual lemma of the\nEnglish language or not.\n\n-   Group A achieved 24 correct answers out of 25 trials\n\n-   Group B obtained 19 correct answers out of 25 trials.\n\n-   To see, whether the proportions are significantly different, the\n    following code can be used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprop.test(c(24,19), c(25,24))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\t2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction\n\ndata:  c(24, 19) out of c(25, 24)\nX-squared = 1.8525, df = 1, p-value = 0.1735\nalternative hypothesis: two.sided\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.05222032  0.38888699\nsample estimates:\n   prop 1    prop 2 \n0.9600000 0.7916667 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Testing Event Counts Over Time: The Poisson Test\n\nFor analysing event counts over time, such as pauses in speech, the\n**Poisson distribution** with the `poisson.test()` function can be useful.\n\n**Example**: An experiment is conducted in which speakers are asked to\ntalk for a predetermined time. and it is being researched how often\npauses occur in speech.\n\n-   Participant A pauses 18 times in 5 minutes.\n\n-   The researcher expects 2 pauses per minute.\n\n-   To see whether the observed pause rate differs from the expected\n    pause rate, the following test is highly convenient.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npoisson.test(18, T=5, r=2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tExact Poisson test\n\ndata:  18 time base: 5\nnumber of events = 18, time base = 5, p-value = 0.01705\nalternative hypothesis: true event rate is not equal to 2\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 2.133588 5.689552\nsample estimates:\nevent rate \n       3.6 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n",
