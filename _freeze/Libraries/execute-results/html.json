You can now type in the name of the\npackage you would like to install under `Packages`.\n\n**Task**: Install the `tidyverse` and `quanteda` packages!\n\nOnce the installation has been completed, you can proceed to load the\nlibraries using the code below. You can ignore the warning messages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(quanteda)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nRemember that you will have to reload these libraries whenever you start\na new R session (i.e., open RStudio).\n",
