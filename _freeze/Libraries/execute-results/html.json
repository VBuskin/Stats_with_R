You can now type in the name of\nthe package you would like to install under `Packages`.\n\n[Video tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1r5XTqrCTQ)\n:::\n\nThis reader will use functions from a variety of R packages. Please\ninstall the following ones:\n\n| Package | Purpose |  Session | \n|---------|---------| ---------| \n| `readxl` | Importing Microsoft Excel files | [Importing/exporting](Importing_exporting.qmd)\n| `writexl` | Exporting Microsoft Excel files | [Importing/exporting](Importing_exporting.qmd)\n| `quanteda` | Analysis of text data | [Concordancing](Concordancing.qmd)\n| `lattice` | Data visualisation | [Concordancing](Concordancing.qmd)\n| `tidyverse` | Framework for data manipulation and visualisation | [Categorical data](Categorical_data.qmd), [Continuous data](Summary_statistics.qmd)\n| `crosstable` | Creating contingency tables | [Categorical data](Categorical_data.qmd)\n| `flextable` | Exporting contingency tables | [Categorical data](Categorical_data.qmd)\n| `confintr` | Effect size measure for categorical data| [Chi-squared test](Chi_square_test.qmd)\n\n\n### Loading packages\n\nOnce the installation has been completed, you can proceed to load the\nlibraries using the code below. You can ignore the warning messages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(writexl)\nlibrary(quanteda)\nlibrary(lattice)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(crosstable)\nlibrary(flextable)\nlibrary(confintr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"false\" title=\"Activating libraries\"}\nWhenever you start a new R session (i.e., open RStudio), your libraries\nand their respective functions will be inactive. To re-activate a\nlibrary, either use the `library()` function or simply select it in the\n`Packages` tab.\n:::\n\nIt is good practice to only activate those packages that are necessary\nfor your analysis. While it won't be a problem for the small set of\npackages as shown here, loading dozens of packages increases the risk of\nobtaining \"homonymous\" functions which have the same name but perform\ndifferent operations. In this case, it might be helpful to\n\"disambiguate\" them by directly indicating which package a function is\nfrom:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreadxl::read_xlsx(...)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Citing R and R packages\n\nWhenever we draw on ideas other than our own, we give credit to the\nrespective source by citing it appropriately. The same applies to R,\nRStudio as well as all the packages we rely on throughout our analyses.\n\nFor R, an up-to-date citation can be generated as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncitation()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nTo cite R in publications use:\n\n  R Core Team (2023). R: A language and environment for statistical\n  computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.\n  URL https://www.R-project.org/.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n    author = {{R Core Team}},\n    organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n    address = {Vienna, Austria},\n    year = {2023},\n    url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n  }\n\nWe have invested a lot of time and effort in creating R, please cite it\nwhen using it for data analysis. See also 'citation(\"pkgname\")' for\nciting R packages.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nTo cite a specific package, simply supply the package name as an\nargument.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncitation(\"quanteda\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nTo cite package 'quanteda' in publications use:\n\n  Benoit K, Watanabe K, Wang H, Nulty P, Obeng A, Müller S, Matsuo A\n  (2018). \"quanteda: An R package for the quantitative analysis of\n  textual data.\" _Journal of Open Source Software_, *3*(30), 774.\n  doi:10.21105/joss.00774 <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00774>,\n  <https://quanteda.io>.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Article{,\n    title = {quanteda: An R package for the quantitative analysis of textual data},\n    journal = {Journal of Open Source Software},\n    author = {Kenneth Benoit and Kohei Watanabe and Haiyan Wang and Paul Nulty and Adam Obeng and Stefan Müller and Akitaka Matsuo},\n    doi = {10.21105/joss.00774},\n    url = {https://quanteda.io},\n    volume = {3},\n    number = {30},\n    pages = {774},\n    year = {2018},\n  }\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n",
