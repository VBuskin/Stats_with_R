It compares the observed frequencies of categories with those expected under the null hypothesis. The $\\chi^2$ (chi-squared) score quantifies the difference between observed and expected frequencies for every cell in a contingency table. The greater the difference between observed and expected, the higher the $\\chi^2$ score and the lower the $p$-value, given the degrees of freedom. It is recommended to compute effect size measures and inspect the residuals to assess the nature of the association.\nformat:\n  html:\n    self-contained: true\n    code-fold: false\n    theme: default\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 4\n    number-sections: true\n    slide-number: true\n    incremental: false\n    slide-level: 3\n    scrollable: true\neditor: visual\nbibliography: R.bib\nmetadata-files:\n  - _quarto.yml\ngoogle-scholar: false\n---\n\n\n## Suggested reading\n\nFor linguists:\n\n> @gries_statistics_2021: Chapter 4.1.2.1\n\nGeneral:\n\n> @baguleySeriousStatsGuide2012: Chapter 4\n>\n> @agrestiFoundationsStatisticsData2022: Chapter 5\n\n## Preparation\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Script\n\nYou can find the full R script associated with this unit\n[here](https://osf.io/u7f8w).\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#  Load libraries\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(confintr) # for effect size calculation\n\n# Load data\ncl.order <- read_xlsx(\"Paquot_Larsson_2020_data.xlsx\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The Pearson $\\chi^2$-test of independence\n\nThe first step of any significance test involves setting up the null and\nalternative hypothesis. In this unit, we will perform a sample analysis\non the relationship between clause `ORDER` and the type of subordinate\nclause (`SUBORDTYPE`). Specifically, we will focus on the\n**independence** of these two discrete variables (i.e, the presence or\nabsence of correlation).\n\n-   $H_0:$ The variables `ORDER` and `SUBORDTYPE` are independent.\n\n-   $H_1:$ The variables `ORDER` and `SUBORDTYPE` are **not**\n    independent.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"What does independence really mean?\" collapse=\"true\"}\nThe core idea is \"that the probability distribution of the response\nvariable is the same for each group\"\n[@agrestiFoundationsStatisticsData2022: 177]. If clause `ORDER` is the\nresponse variable and `SUBORDTYPE` the explanatory variable,\nindependence would entail that the probabilities of the outcomes of the\nresponse variable `ORDER = \"mc-sc\"` and `ORDER = \"sc-mc\"` are not\ninfluenced by whether they occur in the groups `SUBORDTYPE = \"temp\"` or\n`SUBORDTYPE = \"caus\"`.\n\nThe term **probability distribution** refers to a mathematical function\nthat assigns probabilities to the outcomes of a variable. If we consider\ntwo variables at the same time, such as $X$ and $Y$, they are said to\nhave **marginal probability functions** $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(y)$. If we\ncondition the outcomes of all values on each other, the following\nequivalence will hold:\n\n$$\nf(x \\mid y) = f_1(x) \\text{ and } f(y \\mid x) = f_2(y).\n$$ {#eq-indep}\n\nThus, the null hypothesis assumes that the probabilities of each\ncombination of values (such as `ORDER` and `SUBORDTYPE`), denoted by\n$\\pi_{ij}$, have the relationship in @eq-indep. This can be stated\nsuccinctly as\n\n$$\nH_0 : \\pi_{ij} = P(X = j)P(Y = i).\n$$ {#eq-nullhyp-math}\n:::\n\nNext, we compute a test statistic that indicates how strongly our data\nconforms to $H_0$, such as Pearson's $\\chi^2$. To this end, we will need\ntwo types of values:\n\n-   the **observed frequencies** $f_{ij}$ present in our data set\n\n-   the **expected frequencies** $e_{ij}$, which we would expect to see\n    if $H_0$ were true,\n\nwhere $f, e \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The indices $i$ and $j$ uniquely identify\nthe cell counts in all column-row combinations of a contingency table.\n\n### Observerd frequencies\n\nThe table below represents a generic contingency table where $Y$ and $X$\nare categorical variables and have the values\n$Y = \\{y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_i \\}$ and $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_j\\}$. In\nthe table, each cell indicates the count of observation $f_{ij}$\ncorresponding to the $i$-th row and $j$-th column.\n\n|     |       |          | $X$      |     |          |     |\n|-----|-------|----------|----------|-----|----------|-----|\n|     |       | $x_1$    | $x_2$    | ... | $x_j$    |     |\n|     | $y_1$ | $f_{11}$ | $f_{12}$ | ... | $f_{1j}$ |     |\n|     | $y_2$ | $f_{21}$ | $f_{22}$ | ... | $f_{2j}$ |     |\n| $Y$ | ...   | ...      | ...      | ... | ...      |     |\n|     | $y_i$ | $f_{i1}$ | $f_{i2}$ | ... | $f_{ij}$ |     |\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n```\n\nIn the `cl.order` data, the **observed frequencies** correspond to how\noften each `ORDER` value (i.e., `mc-sc` and `sc-mc`) is attested for a\ngiven `SUBORDTYPE` (i.e., `temp` and `caus`). This can be done in a very\nstraightforward fashion using R's `table()` function on the variables of\ninterest.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobserved_freqs <- table(cl.order$ORDER, cl.order$SUBORDTYPE)\n\nprint(observed_freqs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n       \n        caus temp\n  mc-sc  184   91\n  sc-mc   15  113\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Expected frequencies\n\nThe **expected frequencies** require a few additional steps. Usually,\nthese steps are performed automatically when conducting the chi-squared\ntest in R, so you don't have to worry about calculating them by hand. We\nwill do it anyway to drive home the rationale of the test.\n\n|     |       |          | $X$      |     |          |     |\n|-----|-------|----------|----------|-----|----------|-----|\n|     |       | $x_1$    | $x_2$    | ... | $x_j$    |     |\n|     | $y_1$ | $e_{11}$ | $e_{12}$ | ... | $e_{1j}$ |     |\n|     | $y_2$ | $e_{21}$ | $e_{22}$ | ... | $e_{2j}$ |     |\n| $Y$ | ...   | ...      | ...      | ... | ...      |     |\n|     | $y_i$ | $e_{i1}$ | $e_{i2}$ | ... | $e_{ij}$ |     |\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n```\n\nThe expected frequencies $e_{ij}$ are given by the formula in\n@eq-exp-freq. In concrete terms, we go through each cell in the\ncross-table and multiply the corresponding row sums with the column\nsums, dividing the result by the total number of occurrences in the\nsample. For example, there are $184$ occurrences of `mc-sc` clause\norders where the subordinate clause is causal. The row sum is\n$184 + 91 = 275$ and the column sum is $184 + 15 = 199$. Next, we take\ntheir product $275 \\times 199$ and divide it by the total number of\nobservations, which is $184 + 91 + 15 + 113 = 403$. Thus we obtain an\nexpected frequency of $\\frac{275 \\times 199}{403} = 135.79$ under the\nnull hypothesis.\n\n$$\ne_{ij} = \\frac{i\\textrm{th row sum} \\times j \\textrm{th column sum}}{\\textrm{number of observations}}\n$$ {#eq-exp-freq}\n\nThe expected frequencies for our combination of variables is shown\nbelow.

In other words, we can check if the observed object data matches the frequencies we'd expect to see if both outcomes of `object realisation` were equally likely and hence randomly distributed.\n\nOur hypotheses are thus \n\n-   $H_0:$ Observed frequencies of `object realisation` $=$ expected frequencies of `object realisation`\n\n-   $H_1:$ Observed frequencies of `object realisation` $\\neq$ expected frequencies of `object realisation`\n\nThe expected frequencies are given by \n\n$$\ne_i = \\frac{\\text{number of observations}}{\\text{number of cells}},\n$$ {#eq-exp-gof}\n\n\nand the test statistic simplifies to \n\n$$\n\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{I}{\\frac{(f_{i} - e_{i})^2}{e_{i}}}.\n$$ {#eq-chisq-gof}\n\n\nIn R:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Perform the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test\neat_gof <-  chisq.test(eat_observed)\n\nprint(eat_gof)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tChi-squared test for given probabilities\n\ndata:  eat_observed\nX-squared = 1.4118, df = 1, p-value = 0.2348\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Check expected frequencies (should be greater or equal to 5)\nprint(eat_gof$expected)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n no yes \n 51  51 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> A chi-squared goodness-of-fit test indicates that the distribution of object realisation for *eat* does not significantly differ from an equal distribution ($\\chi^2$ = 1.41, df = 1, $p$ = 0.23). In the sample at hand, the verb does not seem to prefer one variant or the other.\n\n\n## Exercises\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Solutions\n\nYou can find the solutions to the exercises\n[here](https://osf.io/m8et2).\n:::\n\n::: {#exr-chisq-1}\nLoad the file [`eat_obj_aspect.xlsx`](https://osf.io/y5scq) into R.
