It compares the observed frequencies of categories with those expected under the null hypothesis. The $\\chi^2$ (chi-squared) score quantifies the difference between observed and expected frequencies for every cell in a contingency table. The greater the difference between observed and expected, the higher the $\\chi^2$ score and the lower the $p$-value, given the degrees of freedom. It is recommended to compute effect size measures and inspect the residuals to assess the nature of the association.\nformat:\n  html:\n    self-contained: true\n    code-fold: false\n    theme: default\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 4\n    number-sections: true\n    slide-number: true\n    incremental: false\n    slide-level: 3\n    scrollable: true\neditor: visual\nbibliography: R.bib\nmetadata-files:\n  - _quarto.yml\ngoogle-scholar: false\n---\n\n\n## Suggested reading\n\nFor linguists:\n\n> @gries_statistics_2021: Chapter 4.1.2.1\n\nGeneral:\n\n> @baguleySeriousStatsGuide2012: Chapter 4\n>\n> @agrestiFoundationsStatisticsData2022: Chapter 5\n\n## Preparation\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Script\n\nYou can find the full R script associated with this unit [here](https://osf.io/u7f8w).\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#  Load libraries\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(confintr) # for effect size calculation\n\n# Load data\ncl.order <- read_xlsx(\"Paquot_Larsson_2020_data.xlsx\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## The Pearson $\\chi^2$-test of independence\n\nThe first step of any significance test involves setting up the null and alternative hypothesis. In this unit, we will perform a sample analysis on the relationship between clause `ORDER` and the type of subordinate clause (`SUBORDTYPE`). Specifically, we will focus on the **independence** of these two discrete variables (i.e, the presence or absence of correlation).\n\n-   $H_0:$ The variables `ORDER` and `SUBORDTYPE` are independent.\n\n-   $H_1:$ The variables `ORDER` and `SUBORDTYPE` are **not** independent.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"What does independence really mean?\" collapse=\"true\"}\nThe core idea is \"that the probability distribution of the response variable is the same for each group\" [@agrestiFoundationsStatisticsData2022: 177]. If clause `ORDER` is the response variable and `SUBORDTYPE` the explanatory variable, independence would entail that the probabilities of the outcomes of the response variable `ORDER = \"mc-sc\"` and `ORDER = \"sc-mc\"` are not influenced by whether they occur in the groups `SUBORDTYPE = \"temp\"` or `SUBORDTYPE = \"caus\"`.\n\nThe term **probability distribution** refers to a mathematical function that assigns probabilities to the outcomes of a variable. If we consider two variables at the same time, such as $X$ and $Y$, they are said to have **marginal probability functions** $f_1(x)$ and $f_2(y)$. If we condition the outcomes of all values on each other, the following equivalence will hold:\n\n$$\nf(x \\mid y) = f_1(x) \\text{ and } f(y \\mid x) = f_2(y).\n$$ {#eq-indep}\n\nThus, the null hypothesis assumes that the probabilities of each combination of values (such as `ORDER` and `SUBORDTYPE`), denoted by $\\pi_{ij}$, have the relationship in @eq-indep. This can be stated succinctly as\n\n$$\nH_0 : \\pi_{ij} = P(X = j)P(Y = i).\n$$ {#eq-nullhyp-math}\n:::\n\nNext, we compute a test statistic that indicates how strongly our data conforms to $H_0$, such as Pearson's $\\chi^2$. To this end, we will need two types of values:\n\n-   the **observed frequencies** $f_{ij}$ present in our data set\n\n-   the **expected frequencies** $e_{ij}$, which we would expect to see if $H_0$ were true,\n\nwhere $f, e \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The indices $i$ and $j$ uniquely identify the cell counts in all column-row combinations of a contingency table.\n\n### Observerd frequencies\n\nThe table below represents a generic contingency table where $Y$ and $X$ are categorical variables and have the values $Y = \\{y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_i \\}$ and $X = \\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_j\\}$. In the table, each cell indicates the count of observation $f_{ij}$ corresponding to the $i$-th row and $j$-th column.\n\n|     |       |          | $X$      |     |          |     |\n|-----|-------|----------|----------|-----|----------|-----|\n|     |       | $x_1$    | $x_2$    | ... | $x_j$    |     |\n|     | $y_1$ | $f_{11}$ | $f_{12}$ | ... | $f_{1j}$ |     |\n|     | $y_2$ | $f_{21}$ | $f_{22}$ | ... | $f_{2j}$ |     |\n| $Y$ | ...   | ...      | ...      | ... | ...      |     |\n|     | $y_i$ | $f_{i1}$ | $f_{i2}$ | ... | $f_{ij}$ |     |\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n```\n\n\nIn the `cl.order` data, the **observed frequencies** correspond to how often each `ORDER` value (i.e., `mc-sc` and `sc-mc`) is attested for a given `SUBORDTYPE` (i.e., `temp` and `caus`). This can be done in a very straightforward fashion using R's `table()` function on the variables of interest.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobserved_freqs <- table(cl.order$ORDER, cl.order$SUBORDTYPE)\n\nprint(observed_freqs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n       \n        caus temp\n  mc-sc  184   91\n  sc-mc   15  113\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Expected frequencies\n\nThe **expected frequencies** require a few additional steps. Usually, these steps are performed automatically when conducting the chi-squared test in R, so you don't have to worry about calculating them by hand. We will do it anyway to drive home the rationale of the test.\n\n|     |       |          | $X$      |     |          |     |\n|-----|-------|----------|----------|-----|----------|-----|\n|     |       | $x_1$    | $x_2$    | ... | $x_j$    |     |\n|     | $y_1$ | $e_{11}$ | $e_{12}$ | ... | $e_{1j}$ |     |\n|     | $y_2$ | $e_{21}$ | $e_{22}$ | ... | $e_{2j}$ |     |\n| $Y$ | ...   | ...      | ...      | ... | ...      |     |\n|     | $y_i$ | $e_{i1}$ | $e_{i2}$ | ... | $e_{ij}$ |     |\n\n\n```{=html}\n<div style=\"margin-top: 20px;\"></div>\n```\n\n\nThe expected frequencies $e_{ij}$ are given by the formula in @eq-exp-freq. In concrete terms, we go through each cell in the cross-table and multiply the corresponding row sums with the column sums, dividing the result by the total number of occurrences in the sample. For example, there are $184$ occurrences of `mc-sc` clause orders where the subordinate clause is causal. The row sum is $184 + 91 = 275$ and the column sum is $184 + 15 = 199$. Next, we take their product $275 \\times 199$ and divide it by the total number of observations, which is $184 + 91 + 15 + 113 = 403$. Thus we obtain an expected frequency of $\\frac{275 \\times 199}{403} = 135.79$ under the null hypothesis.\n\n$$\ne_{ij} = \\frac{i\\textrm{th row sum} \\times j \\textrm{th column sum}}{\\textrm{number of observations}}\n$$ {#eq-exp-freq}\n\nThe expected frequencies for our combination of variables is shown below.

It measures how much the observed frequencies **deviate** from the expected frequencies **for each cell** in a contingency table [cf. @heumann_introduction_2022: 249-251]. The gist of this procedure is summarised in @eq-chisq-simple.\n\n$$\n\\text{Chi-squared } \\chi^2 =\\frac{(\\text{observed} - \\text{expected})^2}{\\text{expected}}\n$$ {#eq-chisq-simple}\n\n::: {.callout-note collapse=\"true\" title=\"Formal definition of the $\\\\chi^2$-test\"}\nGiven $n$ observations and $k$ degrees of freedom $df$, the joint squared deviations between $f_{ij}$ and $e_{ij}$ contribute to the final $\\chi^2$-score, which is defined as\n\n$$\n\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{I}\\sum_{j=1}^{J}{\\frac{(f_{ij} - e_{ij})^2}{e_{ij}}}\n$$ {#eq-chisq}\n\nfor $i = 1, ..., I$ and $j = 1, ..., J$ and $df = (\\textrm{number of rows} -1) \\times (\\textrm{number of columns} - 1)$.\n\nApplying the formula, the updated contingency would have the following form:\n\n|   |   |   | $X$ |   |   |   |\n|----------|----------|------------|------------|----------|------------|----------|\n|  |  | $x_1$ | $x_2$ | ... | $x_j$ |  |\n|  | $y_1$ | $\\frac{(f_{11} - e_{11})^2}{e_{11}}$ | $\\frac{(f_{12} - e_{12})^2}{e_{12}}$ | ... | $\\frac{(f_{1j} - e_{1j})^2}{e_{1j}}$ |  |\n|  | $y_2$ | $\\frac{(f_{21} - e_{21})^2}{e_{21}}$ | $\\frac{(f_{22} - e_{22})^2}{e_{22}}$ | ... | $\\frac{(f_{2j} - e_{2j})^2}{e_{2j}}$ |  |\n| $Y$ | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |  |\n|  | $y_i$ | $\\frac{(f_{i1} - e_{i1})^2}{e_{i1}}$ | $\\frac{(f_{i2} - e_{i1})^2}{e_{i2}}$ | ... | $\\frac{(f_{ij} - e_{ij})^2}{e_{ij}}$ |  |\n:::\n\nThe implementation in R is a simple one-liner. Keep in mind that we have to supply **absolute frequencies** to `chisq.test()` rather than percentages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfreqs_test <- chisq.test(observed_freqs)\n\nprint(freqs_test)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tPearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction\n\ndata:  observed_freqs\nX-squared = 104.24, df = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nQuite conveniently, the test object `freqs_test` stores the expected frequencies, which can be easily accessed via subsetting.

Violations of these assumptions decrease the validity of the result and could, therefore, lead to wrong conclusions about relationships in the data. In this case, other tests should be consulted.\n\n::: callout-important\n1.  All observations are independent of each other.\n2.  80% of the expected frequencies are $\\geq$ 5.\n3.  All observed frequencies are $\\geq$ 1.\n:::\n\nIn case of dependent observations (e.g., multiple measurements per participant), the default approach is to fit a multilevel model that can control for grouping factors (see mixed-effects regression in @sec-mer.)\n\nIf assumptions 2 and 3 are violated, it is recommended to use a more robust test such as the **Fisher's Exact Test** or the **log-likelihood ratio test** ($G$-test).\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" title=\"Fisher's Exact Test\"}\nWhile the $\\chi^2$-test can only approximate the $p$-value, Fisher's Exact Test can provide an exact solution. Note that for anything more complex than a $2 \\times 2$ table, it becomes considerably more computationally expensive; if it takes too long, set `simulate.p.value = TRUE`.\n\nDrawing on the hypergeometric distribution (see `?dhyper()`), it computes the probability of all frequency tables that are equal or more extreme than the one observed.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfisher.test(observed_freqs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tFisher's Exact Test for Count Data\n\ndata:  observed_freqs\np-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true odds ratio is not equal to 1\n95 percent confidence interval:\n  8.216959 29.548120\nsample estimates:\nodds ratio \n  15.11768 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" title=\"$G$-test\"}\nThe $G^2$-statistic is analogous to $\\chi^2$, but it tends to be more robust for lower observed counts.

Here a few possible wordings that could be used:\n\n> According to a $\\chi^2$-test, there is a highly significant association between clause ORDER and SUBORDTYPE at $p < 0.001$ ($\\chi^2 = 106.44, df = 1$), thus justifying the rejection of $H_0$.\n\n> A $\\chi^2$-test revealed a highly significant association between clause ORDER and SUBORDTYPE ($\\chi^2(1) = 106.44$, $p < 0.001$), supporting the rejection of $H_0$.\n\n> The $\\chi^2$-test results ($\\chi^2 = 106.44$, $df = 1$, $p < 0.001$) provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis, demonstrating a significant association between clause ORDER and SUBORDTYPE.\n\nThe test results suggest that the dependent variable `ORDER` and the explanatory variable `SUBORDTYPE` are not independent of each other. The probability of **randomly** observing usage patterns such as those found in the `cl.order` data is lower than 0.001 $\\approx$ 0.1%, which is enough to reject the null hypothesis at $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nWe can infer that a speaker's choice of clause `ORDER` is very likely influenced by the semantic type of subordinate clause; in other words, these two variables are **correlated**. However, there are still several things the test does **not** tell us:\n\n-   Are there certain variable combinations where the $\\chi^2$-scores are particularly high?\n\n-   How strongly do `ORDER` and `SUBORDTYPE` influence each other?\n\n## Pearson residuals\n\nIf we're interested in what cells show the greatest difference between observed and expected frequencies, an option would be to inspect the Pearson residuals (cf. @eq-pear-res).\n\n$$ \\text{residuals} = \\frac{\\text{observed} - \\text{expected}}{\\sqrt{\\text{expected}}} \n$$ {#eq-pear-res}\n\nThese can be accessed via the test results stored `freqs_test`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfreqs_test$residuals\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n       \n             caus      temp\n  mc-sc  4.136760 -4.085750\n  sc-mc -6.063476  5.988708\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe function `assocplot()` can automatically compute the pearson residuals for any given contingency table and create a plot that highlights their contributions. If the bar is above the dashed line, it is black and indicates that a category is observed more frequently than expected (e.g., causal subordinate clauses in the `mc-sc` order). Conversely, bars are coloured grey if a category is considerably less frequent than expected, such as `caus` in `sc-mc`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nassocplot(t(observed_freqs), col = c(\"black\", \"lightgrey\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Chi_square_test_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\" title=\"Testing the residuals: Configural Frequency Analysis\"}\nThe chi-squared test only provides a $p$-value for the entire contingency table.
