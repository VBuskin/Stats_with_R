In\n> contrast, in conforming to the traditional quotative *say*, men and\n> women over forty displayed similar behavior\"\n> [@barbieriOlderMenYounger2007: 38–39].\n\n### Some of her conclusions\n\n> \"In favoring *be like* over other quotatives, men in their late 20s\n> and in their 30s display an 'affinity' with slightly younger women,\n> women in their early 20s, rather than with women of their same age\"\n> [@barbieriOlderMenYounger2007: 41].\n\n## Principles of Empirical Linguistics\n\n-   **Objectivity** — Independence from researchers or devices (→\n    replicability!)\n\n-   **Reliability** — Studies should be replicable.\n\n-   **Validity** — A study must actually address the problem formulated\n    in the research question.\n",
