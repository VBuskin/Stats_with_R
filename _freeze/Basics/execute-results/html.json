In\ncontrast, in conforming to the traditional quotative *say*, men and\nwomen over forty displayed similar behavior\" (38-39)\n\n### Some of her conclusions\n\n> \"In favoring *be like* over other quotatives, men in their late 20s and in their 30s display an 'affinity' with slightly younger women, women in their early 20s, rather than with women of their same age\" (41).\n\n## Principles of Empirical Linguistics\n\n-   **Objectivity** — Independence from researchers or devices (→\n    replicability!)\n\n-   **Reliability** — Studies should be replicable.\n\n-   **Validity** — A study must actually address the problem formulated\n    in the research question.\n",
