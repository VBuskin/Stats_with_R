## What is a linguistic variable?

1.  **The classical view:** Labov [-@labov1972] defines a linguistic
    variable as "two ways of saying the same thing."

2.  **A restriction:** Meyerhoff [-@meyerhoff2009: 11] summarized, "In
    sum, a sociolinguistic variable can be defined as a linguistic
    variable that is constrained by social or non-linguistic factors..."

3.  **A more open view:** Kiesling [-@kiesling2011] argued, "Given the
    variability of what counts as a variable, we must define what counts
    as a variable more broadly than 'two or more ways of saying the same
    thing'. We will simply say that a linguistic variable is a choice or
    option about speaking in a speech community... Note that this
    definition does not in any way require us to state that the meaning
    be the same, although there should be some kind of equivalence
    noted."

## Discussion

Which of the following variables are good sociolinguistic variables, and
which of them are poor?

1.  /fɔːθ flɔː/ vs. /fɔːrθ flɔːr/
2.  *This enables him to preside over the process which I have
    described* vs. *This enables him to preside over the process that I
    have described* vs. *This enables him to preside over the process ∅
    I have described*.
3.  *The pair found the briefcase on a bus station bench at Bath central
    bus station.* vs. *The briefcase was found on a bus station bench at
    Bath central bus station by the pair.*
4.  *Art is after all the subject of attention for both critic and
    historian, even though the functions and methods of the two sorts of
    writer have drawn apart.* vs. *Art histories often make an attempt
    to keep to chronology, although the difficulties include the crucial
    fact that in art there is no clear sequence of events.* vs. *Many of
    his readers approved his sensitive and appreciative understanding of
    paintings, though without sharing his political views.*
5.  /pleɪŋ/ vs. /pleɪn/
6.  \[tʰ\] in /tɔp/ vs. \[t\] in *stop*.

## Task

Two linguists aim to study the preference for passives among men and
women. They extract all the passives from 500,000 words of male speech
and all passives from 500,000 words of female speech and report the
results. **What's wrong?**

## Subtypes of variables

### Linguistic perspective

1.  phonetic/phonological
2.  morphological
3.  syntactic
4.  pragmatic

### Sociolinguistic perspective

Sociolinguistic variables also differ with regard to their **salience**
in society.

1.  **Stereotypes** are strongly socially marked and part of popular
    discourse about language.
    -   *h*-dropping in Cockney
    -   Canadian *eh* at the end of sentences
    -   Australian *dinkum*: *I was fair dinkum about my interest in
        their culture* 'authentic, genuine'
2.  **Markers** show both social and style stratification; all members
    of a society react similarly in taking care to **avoid the pattern**
    in **formal registers**.
    -   \(r\)

    -   (th)
3.  **Indicators** differentiate social groups. However, people are not
    aware of them and therefore do not avoid them in formal registers.
    -   Same vowel in *God* and *Guard* in New York City
