	abstract = {A widely-used method in corpus-linguistic approaches to discourse analysis, register/text type/genre analysis, and educational/curriculum questions is that of keywords analysis, a simple statistical method aiming to identify words that are key to, i.e. characteristic for, certain discourses, text types, or topic domains. The vast majority of keywords analyses relied on the same statistical measure that most collocation studies are using, the log-likelihood ratio, which is performed on frequencies of occurrence in two corpora under consideration. In a recent paper, Egbert and Biber (2019) advocated a different approach, one that involves computing log-likelihood ratios for word types based on the range of their distribution rather than their frequencies in the target and reference corpora under consideration. In this paper, I argue that their approach is a most welcome addition to keywords analysis but can still be profitably extended by utilizing both frequency and dispersion for keyness computations. I am presenting a new two-dimensional approach to keyness and exemplifying it on the basis of the Clinton-Trump Corpus and the British National Corpus.\&nbsp;},

In this chapter, we describe how to generate and manipulate concordances, and we discuss how they can be employed in research and teaching. We describe how to generate, sort, and prune concordances prior to further analysis or use. In a section devoted to qualitative analysis, we detail how a discourse-analytical approach, either on the basis of unannotated concordance lines or on the basis of output generated by a prior quantitative examination of the data, can help describe and, crucially, explain the observable patterns, for instance by recourse to concepts such as semantic prosody. In a section devoted to quantitative analysis, we discuss how concordance lines can be scrutinized for various properties of the search term and annotated accordingly. Annotated concordance data enable the researcher to perform statistical analyses over hundreds or thousands of data points, identifying distributional patterns that might otherwise escape the researcher’s attention. In a third section, we turn to pedagogical applications of concordances. We close with a critical assessment of contemporary use of concordances as well as some suggestions for the adequate use of concordances in both research and teaching contexts, and give pointers to tools and resources.},

	abstract = {We investigated the processing of morphologically complex words adopting an approach that goes beyond estimating average effects and allows testing predictions about variability in performance. We tested masked morphological priming effects with English derived (‘printer’) and inflected (‘printed’) forms priming their stems (‘print’) in non-native speakers, a population that is characterized by large variability. We modeled reaction times with a shifted-lognormal distribution using Bayesian distributional models, which allow assessing effects of experimental manipulations on both the mean of the response distribution (‘mu’) and its standard deviation (‘sigma’). Our results show similar effects on mean response times for inflected and derived primes, but a difference between the two on the sigma of the distribution, with inflectional priming increasing response time variability to a significantly larger extent than derivational priming. This is in line with previous research on non-native processing, which shows more variable results across studies for the processing of inflected forms than for derived forms. More generally, our study shows that treating variability in performance as a direct object of investigation can crucially inform models of language processing, by disentangling effects which would otherwise be indistinguishable. We therefore emphasize the importance of looking beyond average performance and testing predictions on other parameters of the distribution rather than just its central tendency.},

	abstract = {A new, information-theoretic model of selectional constraints is proposed. The strategy adopted here is a minimalist one: how far can one get making as few assumptions as possible? In keeping with that strategy, the proposed model consists of only two components: first, a fairly generic taxonomic representation of concepts, and, second, a probabilistic formalization of selectional constraints defined in terms of that taxonomy, computed on the basis of simple, observable frequencies of co-occurrence between predicates and their arguments. Unlike traditional selection restrictions, the information-theoretic approach avoids empirical problems associated with definitional theories of word meaning, accommodates the observation that semantic anomaly often appears to be a matter of degree, and provides an account of how selectional constraints can be learned. A computational implementation of the model “learns” selectional constraints from collections of naturally occurring text; the predictions of the implemented model are evaluated against judgments elicited from adult subjects, and used to explore the way that arguments are syntactically realized for a class of English verbs. The paper concludes with a discussion of the role of selectional constraints in the acquisition of verb meaning.},

	abstract = {The number of databases that provide various measurements of lexical properties for psycholinguistic research has increased rapidly in recent years. The proliferation of lexical variables, and the multitude of associated databases, makes the choice, comparison, and standardization of these variables in psycholinguistic research increasingly difficult. Here, we introduce The South Carolina Psycholinguistic Metabase (SCOPE), which is a metabase (or a meta-database) containing an extensive, curated collection of psycholinguistic variable values from major databases. The metabase currently contains 245 lexical variables, organized into seven major categories: General (e.g., frequency), Orthographic (e.g., bigram frequency), Phonological (e.g., phonological uniqueness point), Orth-Phon (e.g., consistency), Semantic (e.g., concreteness), Morphological (e.g., number of morphemes), and Response variables (e.g., lexical decision latency). We hope that SCOPE will become a valuable resource for researchers in psycholinguistics and affiliated disciplines such as cognitive neuroscience of language, computational linguistics, and communication disorders. The availability and ease of use of the metabase with comprehensive set of variables can facilitate the understanding of the unique contribution of each of the variables to word processing, and that of interactions between variables, as well as new insights and development of improved models and theories of word processing. It can also help standardize practice in psycholinguistics. We demonstrate use of the metabase by measuring relationships between variables in multiple ways and testing their individual contribution towards a number of dependent measures, in the most comprehensive analysis of this kind to date. The metabase is freely available at go.sc.edu/scope.},

To operationalize (iii), this article compares the writings of different communities to offer corpus and experimental evidence that verbs omit their objects more readily in the communities in which they are more strongly associated with a routine.

The present study explores the influence of these factors across different modalities (speech vs writing) and genres (e.g. press, fiction, etc.), and models the mediating effect of language-external variables on internal cognitive and linguistic factors within the context of a probabilistic grammar of genitive choice. The discussion revolves around debates concerning the driving force(s) behind recent changes in newspaper genitives, concluding that the trend reflects a push toward more economical modes of expression in reportage texts. Curiously, analysis finds few significant interactions with low-level processing-related factors, e.g. possessor frequency and lexical density – a surprising result in light of recent research. However, analysis further reveals significant inter-genre variability among several other crucial factors including possessor animacy and final sibilancy, which are significantly reduced in journalistic prose.

Contra many claims in the literature that these verbs have highly circumscribed distributions, we demonstrate that they readily appear in a wide variety of argument structure frames. The appearance of causative verbs with omitted patient arguments is analyzed in particular detail and an account is offered in which properties of information structure play a critical role. Constructional influences and lexical semantic factors are shown to be relevant as well, both in the case of omitted arguments and in licensing resultative and path phrases.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

In this paper, we focus on gap filling of definite null instantiation, namely, finding an antecedent for a given definite null instantiation from context. Most of the approaches for solving this problem use syntactic features, and only few consider semantic features. Moreover, these approaches only take the noun, noun phrase and pronoun as candidate words, so the coverage of antecedent is narrow. In this paper, we use new features of words and frame except traditional features, and create a rule to build candidate words set. At last, we choose the best candidate words set and feature template based on employing standard annotated corpus, then use them to deal with corpus of {NIs} only in task {SemEval}-10 Task 10. According to the experimental results, our approach achieves a better performance than existing approaches.},

	abstract = {This paper argues that the phenomenon of the null instantiation of objects, i.e. the property of some transitive verbs to omit their direct complements, can be viewed as a polysemy-trigger. Our study, adopting a lexical complexity perspective, suggests that in the majority of cases verbs retain traits of their prototypical meaning, which becomes the starting point for possible inferences, contributing to the overall interpretative process, and leading to the dynamic emergence of different semantic interpretations and nuances through complex mechanisms of figure and ground.Corpus-data on the verb see support the main typologies of null objects outlined, as well as the main factors attested to play a role in licensing null objects. Moreover, the deprofiling of the object in the case of a nuclear verb like see triggers the emergence of new pragmatic meanings, which cannot be derived from the lexical meanings of the various elements in a proposition taken in isolation, but which are interactionally-driven and surface in unpredictable ways, determining a progressive shift towards the cognitive dimension of the verb.},

Specifically, we contrast causal, concessive, conditional, and temporal adverbial clauses produced by German and Chinese learners of English with those produced by native speakers. We examined 2,362 attestations from the Chinese and German subsections of the International Corpus of Learner English (Granger, Dagneaux, Meunier, \&amp; Paquot, ) and from the Louvain Corpus of Native English Essays (Granger, ). All instances were annotated for the ordering, the subordinate clause type, the lengths of the main and subordinate clauses, the first language of the speakers, the conjunction used, and the file it originated from (as a proxy for the speaker producing the sentence so as to be able to study individual and lexical variation). The results of a two-step regression modeling protocol suggest that learners behave most nativelike with causal clauses and struggle most with conditional and concessive clauses; in addition, learners make more non-nativelike choices when the main and subordinate clause are of about equal length.},

In this chapter, we will extend and test their proposal to determine whether it can also be applied to pragmatic and grammatical phenomena (subject realization/omission in Japanese), and whether it can help study categorical differences between learner and native-speaker choices; we do so by also showing that the more advanced method of mixed-effects modeling can be very fruitfully integrated into the proposed {MuPDAR} method. The results of our study show that Japanese native speakers’ choices of subject realization are affected by discourse-functional factors such as givenness and contrast of referents and that, while learners are able to handle extreme values of givenness and marked cases of contrast, they still struggle (more) with intermediate degrees of givenness and unmarked/non-contrastive referents. We conclude by discussing the role of {MuPDAR} in Learner Corpus Research in general and its advantages over traditional corpus analysis in that field and error analysis in particular.},

A multivariate analysis of 8,507 tokens revealed that the linguistic constraints that affect Chinese subject pronoun use include switch in subject referents, person/number/animacy of the subject, specificity of subject referents, and sentence type. In regards to social factors, age, gender and occupation were significant. Older speakers/teachers/females are more likely to realize subject pronouns than younger speakers/students/males.

Whereas Modern English is the textbook example of a non-null-subject language, the case has recently been made that Old English permits null subjects to a limited extent, which raises the question of what happens in the middle period. In this article we investigate Middle English using data drawn from the Penn–Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Middle English Prose and the new Parsed Corpus of Middle English Poetry, aiming to shed light on the linguistic and extralinguistic factors conditioning the alternation between null and overt subjects. Generalized mixed-effects logistic regression and random forests are used to assess the importance of the variables included. We show that the set of factors at play is similar to that found for Old English, and we document a near-complete disappearance of the null subject option by the end of the Middle English period.},

Aspects of that experience, for instance, the frequency of use of certain constructions or particular instances of constructions, have an impact on representation that is evidenced in speaker knowledge of conventionalized phrases and in language variation and change. It is shown that particular instances of constructions can acquire their own pragmatic, semantic, and phonological characteristics. In addition, it is argued that high-frequency instances of constructions undergo grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency instances under the pressure of newer formations. An exemplar model that accommodates both phonological and semantic representation is elaborated to describe the data considered.},

However, while researchers agree that these results characterize grammar as an emergent phenomenon, there is no consensus among usage-based scholars as to how the various results can be explained and integrated into an explicit theory or model. Building on network theory, the current paper outlines a structured network approach to the study of grammar in which the core concepts of syntax are analyzed by a set of relations that specify associations between different aspects of a speaker's linguistic knowledge. These associations are shaped by domain-general processes that can give rise to new structures and meanings in language acquisition and language change. Combining research from linguistics and psychology, the paper proposes specific network analyses for the following phenomena: argument structure, word classes, constituent structure, constructions and construction families, and grammatical categories such as voice, case and number. The article builds on data and analyses presented in Diessel (2019;) but approaches the topic from a different perspective.},

In contrast to this, Usage-based Construction Grammar advocates a surface-oriented view of syntax and, consequently, eschews the postulation of unexpressed, covert syntactic information. In this paper, we will provide a usage-based explanation as to how such reduced constructions can arise in the first place, namely as online constructs in the working memory. Once reduced structures appear in the input, most approaches concede that they can become conventionalized. In the second part of the paper, we test whether there is any empirical evidence for the conventionalization of the constructions at hand. For this, we draw on one of the largest corpora of spoken English (the {UCLA} {NewsScape} Library of International Television News corpus), which yields more than 28,000 relevant tokens. Analysing these data for their distributional frequency, syntactic environment as well as their emotive content (using automatic sentiment analysis), we will show that there is synchronic evidence to suggest that the two structures are two individual, yet taxonomically related constructions.},

Throughout the emphasis is on the use of logical tools for linguistic semantics, rather than on purely logical topics, and the introductory chapter situates formal semantics within the general framework of linguistic semantics. It assumes some basic knowledge of linguistics, but aims to be as non-technical as possible within a technical subject.

	volume = {31},
	issn = {0922-6567 ; 1573-0573},
	abstract = {A significant challenge for machine translation ({MT}) is the phenomena of dropped pronouns ({DPs}), where certain classes of pronouns are frequently dropped in the source language but should be retained in the target language. In response to this common problem, we propose a semi-supervised approach with a universal frame-work to recall missing pronouns in translation. Firstly, we build training data for {DP} generation in which the {DPs} are automatically labelled according to the alignment information from a parallel corpus. Secondly, we build a deep learning-based {DP} generator for input sentences in decoding when no corresponding references exist. More specifically, the generation has two phases: (1) {DP} position detection, which is modeled as a sequential labelling task with recurrent neural networks; and (2) {DP} prediction, which employs a multilayer perception with rich features. Finally, we integrate the above outputs into our statistical {MT} ({SMT}) system to recall missing pronouns by both extracting rules from the {DP}-labelled training data and translating the {DP}-generated input sentences. To validate the robustness of our approach, we investigate our approach on both Chinese-English and Japanese-English corpora extracted from movie subtitles. Compared with an {SMT} baseline system, experimental results show that our approach achieves a significant improvement of +1.58 {BLEU} points in translation performance with 66\% F-score for {DP} generation accuracy for Chinese-English, and nearly +1 {BLEU} point with 58\% F-score for Japanese-English. We believe that this work could help both {MT} researchers and industries to boost the performance of {MT} systems between pro-drop and non-pro-drop languages.},

	title = {Never saw one – first-person null subjects in spoken English},
	volume = {22},
	abstract = {While null subjects are a well-researched phenomenon in pro-drop languages like Italian or Spanish, they have not received much attention in non-pro-drop languages such as English, where they are traditionally associated with particular (written) genres such as diaries or are discussed under a broader umbrella term such as situational ellipsis. However, examples such as the one in the title – while certainly not frequent – are commonly encountered in colloquial speech, with first-person singular tokens outnumbering any other person.
This article investigates the linguistic and non-linguistic factors influencing the (non-) realisation of first-person singular subjects in a corpus of colloquial English. The variables found to contribute to the observed variation are drawn from a variety of linguistic domains and follow up on research conducted in such different fields as first language acquisition ({FLA}), cognitive linguistics, discourse analysis, sociolinguistics and language variation and change. Of particular interest is the finding regarding the link between null subjects and complexity of the verb phrase, which patterns in a clearly linear fashion: the more complex the verb phrase, the more likely is a null realisation. Not discussed in this form before, this finding, given its high significance and its robustness in light of alternative coding, may prove to be an important candidate for inclusion in future studies on (English) null subjects.},

Specifically, we use distributional trends in the Switchboard corpus to revise several conclusions reached by Prince (1981a, 1981b, 1997) concerning the function of Left Dislocation. While Prince maintains that Left Dislocation has no unitary function, we argue that the distinct uses of the construction identified by Prince can be subsumed under the general function of topic promotion. While Prince claims that Topicalization is a more pragmatically specialized construction than Left Dislocation, we argue that Left Dislocation has equally restrictive and distinct use conditions, which reflect its status as a topic-promoting device. We conclude that computational corpus methods provide an important check on the validity of claims concerning pragmatic markedness.},

As an illustration of this, the data from three different studies are reanalyzed in order to show that an otherwise unexplained order of acquisition can be accounted for from a markedness perspective. There is still a need, however, for looking beyond the distributional characteristics of the exponents of formal syntax if a greater understanding of the acquisition of more complex language is to be achieved. Of prime interest, therefore, is the extent to which we can apply markedness theory to discourse, and a framework for viewing discourse from a markedness perspective is suggested.},

The results support current proposals for a predicative structure at the pragmatics–syntax interface and point to further reﬁnements of the theoretical framework. In particular, the parallel treatment of {vP} shells and Speech {ActP} shells is extended to the relation between Case and syntactic positions, yielding a distinction between two Cases in the pragmatic ﬁeld: Exclamative Case for {DPs} of indirect address, and Vocative Case for {DPs} of direct address. In this framework, the syntactic and the pragmatic ﬁelds undergo similar operations for licensing {DPs} in argument positions.},

A key question asked in this paper is whether or to what extent the ‘Dynamic Model’ of the evolution of Postcolonial Englishes is able to explain these processes and can be applied to Extending Circle countries as well. A decade after its first influential publication, reactions to the model are surveyed systematically, including some new applications, modifications, approaches at testing it, and some criticism. Applying the comparative-descriptive framework of this model and some of its constituent components, the progress of English is outlined in China, Korea, and (less broadly) Japan, the {ASEAN}, Thailand, Namibia, and Rwanda. Furthermore, it is argued that a similar dynamism is driving the widespread emergence of hybrid mixes between local languages and English and phenomena of ‘poststructuralist diffusion,’ English being adopted by whatever means, in fragments and unconstrained of norm concerns, driven by strongly utilitarian considerations. A tabular summary assessment compares these processes with constituents of the Dynamic Model and finds that despite some similarities it is not well suited to grasp the vibrant developments of the Expanding Circle. Instead, the notion of ‘transnational attraction’ is defined and proposed as an appropriate conceptual framework.},

This article argues that despite all obvious dissimilarities, a fundamentally uniform developmental process, shaped by consistent sociolinguistic and language-contact conditions, has operated in the individual instances of rerooting the English language in another territory. At the heart of this process there are characteristic stages of identity construction by the groups involved, with similar relationships between the parties in migration contact settings (i.e. the indigenous population and immigrant groups, respectively) having resulted in analogous processes of mutual accommodation and, consequently, similar sociolinguistic and structural outcomes. Outlining a basic developmental scenario, I suggest that speech communities typically undergo five consecutive phases in this process-foundation, exonormative stabilization, nativization, endonormative stabilization, and differentiation-and I describe the sociolinguistic characteristics of each one. This framework is then applied to case studies of seven different countries (Fiji, Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand) which, I argue, are currently positioned at different points along the developmental cycle.},

Some attention is then given to contrastiveness, a separate phenomenon which is apt to be confused with new information. There follows a brief sketch of some related work in linguistics, together with a few remarks on the status of consciousness within the mainstream of modern psychology, as contrasted with the status of the notion in earlier times. Attention is then turned to the question of why a speaker treats certain information as given, and various grounds for doing so are illustrated. The converse question of why a speaker may stop treating something as given is also discussed. Finally, it is noted that, in certain definable instances, speakers exhibit a mild degree of egocentrism in their assumptions regarding the addressee's consciousness. This point is illustrated with reference to quotations and shallow memory.},

Then the study shows that Mandarin right-dislocation has developed an {EMPHATICfunction} to focus the addressee's attention on the concerned person or object, especially when they are assigned to the topic slot and thus assume the presupposed information status. Furthermore, this emphatic function has a stable association with negative evaluations by the speaker. The combination of the emphatic function and negative evaluation is characterized as the {INTENSIFYING} function. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

It incorporates insights from the theoretical literature but presents them in a way that is accessible to readers without formal training in linguistics. It is based on a sounder and more consistent descriptive framework than previous large-scale grammars, and includes much more explanation of grammatical terms and concepts, together with justification for the ways in which the analysis differs from traditional grammar. The book contains twenty chapters and a guide to further reading. Its usefulness is enhanced by diagrams of sentence structure, cross-references between sections, a comprehensive index, and user-friendly design and typography throughout.},

This paper examines left dislocation tokens from a corpus of spoken English recorded in South Philadelphia. From this emerges a fourth type of left dislocation not previously identified. We define this variety of left dislocation, termed the Unexpected Subject type, via a Centering Theory analysis of the surrounding discourse. This finding adds even greater diversity to the potential discourse functions underlying the left dislocation construction, and thus lends important support to the claim that the association between syntactic form and discourse function is arbitrary. Future research utilizing much larger corpora will not only allow us to hone the definition of the Unexpected Subject type, but may also reveal that there are indeed more discourse functions of the left dislocation construction that have not been identified.},

While it is true that studies of {IVEs} and their acquisition have been impressionistic (non-empirical) and often atheoretical, the lack of rapprochement is also due to {SLA} theory's excessive reliance for its models on acquisition in native-speaker environments and ignorance of the dynamics of language use in multilingual settings. This has resulted in the neglect and misunderstanding of {IVEs}. It is shown that {IVEs} represent a number of significant sociolinguistic and psycholinguistic variables, the investigation of which will put {SLA} theory on firmer theoretical ground and give it greater explanatory power.},

This cross-linguistic variation is believed to be related to the underspecification of I and topic drop in Chinese but not in English. This paper reports on an empirical study investigating the unlearning of null subjects and null objects by 159 Chinese learners in their L2 acquisition of English. In L1 acquisition, it has been found that English-speaking children display an asymmetry by frequently allowing null subjects but rarely null objects. The results of this study indicate that there is an asymmetry in Chinese learners' L2 English, which, however, is opposite to that found in English L1 acquisition: Chinese learners are able to reject the incorrect null subject in English, but unable to detect the ungrammaticality of the null object. It is proposed that the unlearning of null subjects by Chinese learners of English is triggered by the evidence in their input indicating the specification of {AGR}(eement) and T(ense) in English, and that the difficulty in the unlearning of null objects is related to the lack of informative evidence to unset the [+ topic-drop] setting in Chinese learners' L2 English.]},

We present a hitherto unnoticed observation that the otherwise liberal omission of the subject in {CSE} is blocked by the subject agreement –s appropriated from its English lexiﬁer. Our central idea here is that meager agreement in {CSE} must be licensed/valuated by an overt {NP} through the speciﬁer-head relation (Speas, 1994, 2006). This idea, coupled with Huang's theory of null arguments, captures the radical pro drop phenomenon in {CSE}. Our proposed analysis not only correctly predicts subject–object asymmetries with respect to reference and crossover effects in {CSE} but also derives the new observation that poor agreement in {CSE} blocks the generation of the empty category in subject position, but not in object position. We further compare our analysis with two recent alternative theories of the radical pro drop phenomenon presented by Neeleman and Szendröi (2007) and Saito (2007). We show that our analysis successfully circumvents the empirical problems {CSE} raises for these theories.},

One recent theory by Saito (2007) suggests that this process, technically analyzed through {LF}-Copy, is blocked by /-feature agreements of T with subject {DPs} and v with object {DPs}, respectively. I provide evidence from Case marking, {VP}- and {CP}-ellipsis, and Exceptional Case-Marking constructions that in {CSE} both functional heads possess abstract /-feature agreement, as in Standard English. The agreement theory predicts that neither the null subject nor null object position should permit {AE} in {CSE}. The fact, however, is that {AE} is blocked in subject positions but permitted in object positions. I propose that {AE} in {CSE} is controlled, instead, by the presence of an operator–variable topic chain, formed to reﬂect the language’s topic-prominent proﬁle, as manifested in its deﬁnite subject preference. This analysis is supported by the observation that the null subject position allows {AE} in {CSE} as long as it is not linked to the topic position, as in the case of the hanging topic construction. The alternative analysis suggests that the cross-linguistic distribution of {AE} is conditioned by (at least) two parameters: agreement and topichood.},

	abstract = {Abstract.? Cole (2009) concludes that thematic null subjects occur where they are recovered both (a) by reference to an antecedent in context and (b) by subject verb agreement up to the point of morphological maximality, namely the maximum point up to which such agreement occurs in a language (with a tolerance for syncretisms). He also observes that recovery at (a) depends on the contextual strength of a language. This article develops the view that this contextual strength is best defined in terms of an adapted version of Ariel?s (1988, 1990, 1994, 2001) theory of accessibility.},

	abstract = {The possibility of referential null subjects in Old English has been the subject of conflicting assertions. Hulk and van Kemenade (1995:245) stated that “the phenomenon of referential pro-drop does not exist in Old English,” but van Gelderen (2000:137) claimed that “Old English has pro-drop.” This paper presents a systematic quantitative investigation of referential null subjects in Old English, drawing on the York-Toronto-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Old English Prose ({YCOE}; Taylor, Warner, Pintzuk, \& Beths, 2003) and the York-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Old English Poetry ({YCOEP}; Pintzuk \& Plug, 2001). The results indicate substantial variation between texts. In those texts that systematically exhibit null subjects, these are much rarer in subordinate clauses, with first- and second-person null subjects also being rare. I argue that the theory of identification of null subjects by rich verbal agreement is not sufficient to explain the Old English phenomenon, and instead I develop an account based on Holmberg's (2010) analysis of partial null subject languages.},

@article{scott_pragmatically_2013,
	title = {Pragmatically motivated null subjects in English: A relevance theory perspective},
	abstract = {Despite English being traditionally classified as a non-null subject language, there are certain discourse contexts in which subject pronouns may be left non-overt. While previous analyses of this phenomenon have focused on syntactic explanations, each has acknowledged that pragmatics plays a vital role in understanding their production and interpretation. This paper takes up where the syntactic analyses leave off, and offers an analysis of the pragmatic motivation behind null subjects in non-null subject languages, focusing particularly on English. It is argued that, far from being exceptional, pragmatically motivated null subjects are not surprising on a relevance-theoretic approach to utterance production and interpretation (Sperber and Wilson, 1986/95). Three categories of null subject are identified, each driven by the balance between hearer’s effort and cognitive effects, while allowing for the speaker’s abilities and preferences. It is argued that pronouns encode procedural information which guides the hearer to the intended subject referent. Furthermore, the analysis of the discourse contexts in which these subjects may be optionally omitted sheds light not only on the nature of the pronouns themselves, but on the nature of the utterance interpretation process generally, and has important implications for the study of style.},

	abstract = {Authors like Fillmore 1986 and Goldberg 2006 have made a strong case for regarding argument omission in English as a lexical and construction-based affordance rather than one based on general semantico-pragmatic constraints. They do not, however, address the question of how grammatical restrictions on null complementation might interact with broader narrative conventions, in particular those of genre. In this paper, we attempt to remedy this oversight by presenting a comprehensive overview of genre-based argument omissions and offering a construction-based analysis of genre-based omission conventions. We consider five genre-based omission types: instructional imperatives (Culy 1996, Bender 1999), labelese, diary style (Haegeman 1990), match reports (Ruppenhofer 2004) and quotative clauses. We show that these omission types share important traits; all, for example, have anaphoric rather than indefinite construals. We also show, however, that the omission types differ from each other in idiosyncratic ways. We then address several interrelated representational problems posed by the grammatical treatment of genre-based omissions. For example, the constructions that represent genre-based omission conventions must interact with the lexical entries of verbs, many of which do not generally permit omitted arguments. Accordingly, we offer constructional analyses of genre-based omissions that allow constructions to override lexical valence constraints.},

Our results show that even in the typologically similar linguistic habitats of Hong Kong and Singapore, the different degrees of nativisation are reflected in the frequency and distribution of null subjects in the two relevant local varieties.},
